Some say, “He’s interested in you, and he’ll text you in two weeks,” while others deliver bad news via star charts, concluding, in Zhang’s words, that “he’s p****d at you because you f****d around too much”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are more judgmental readings, too, upsetting her further: “You’re not his type.

As a girl, you should play hard to get.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘People are looking for hope’: psychics in demand in Hong Kong</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Distressed and confused, she questions her actions: “I shouldn’t have sent him gifts”; “I shouldn’t have dated casually”; “I shouldn’t have been an easy girl”; “It was my fault that he lost interest in me.”</p>“I felt desperate and blamed myself for the situation,” Zhang tells me. “That’s why I kept talking to psychics on live streams. In retrospect, I realised <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">I was being gaslighted</span></a>, but some psychics slut-shamed me and made me believe I was a hoe.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Every time she spoke to a psychic, one question would lead to another, 10 minutes would become 60, sometimes 90. Looking back, she says, that was the darkest period of her life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Calling in sick to work and cancelling social events, she isolated herself in her apartment. All she cared about was finding clarity in her relationship with Wang, and she sought that through psychic live streams.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Between February and March this year, she says she spent more than 10,000 yuan (US$1,400) on Cece.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/28/7d70050b-fff0-42d0-adeb-65ee6fc6a324_415bcae0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With Beijing issuing ever more regulations on “superstitions”, Cece has positioned itself as a “live-streaming commu­nity for females” in app stores, and thrives under the guise of “counselling”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paul Thagard, a philosopher and cognitive scientist at the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada, says those seeking psychic help are “reinforced by the psychic to do what brings you pleasure and relief. In this case, it’s booking more sessions with the psychic you believe is helping you”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thagard sees this as a form of cognitive bias. When people make decisions based on emotions and personal goals, such as when it comes to relationships and careers, those decisions tend to be made more from motivation than logical judgments.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">He can see dead people: the ‘psychic’ reality TV show star</span></p></a></h3>“If you’re lost or confused, you’ve got <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">anxiety, fear and sadness</span></a>, and want to eliminate those negative emotions,” says Thagard. “Those bad emotions give you strong motivation to find some reassurance. That leads you to find somebody who can reassure you and make you believe everything will be OK.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang says, “Cece is famous among Chinese youth and it fulfils the psychological need for clarity. When there’s no other way to find out answers, people use Cece to peep into unpredictable situations.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Founded in 2011, Cece is the biggest app in China to combine tarot reading, fortunetelling, astrology and counselling under “psychological counselling”.</p>It provides free daily <a rel=nofollow class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">horoscope</span></a> and birth-chart readings on its homepage, but its unique selling point is a user-generated community, which, by November 2022, had connected more than 20 million users and over 20,000 Cece-certified counsellors – who would have had to have passed Cece-devised exams.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The app’s opening gambit is a feature called “Ask a Question”, where visitors type or say something such as “When will I get married?” and receive answers from several psychics based on their payment plan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/28/aa312860-0225-491a-83ec-3d9f78ef180a_319486a5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ten, 20 and 30 yuan generate answers from four, seven and 10 psychics respectively. Higher-level psychics charge 45, 65, 120 or even 200 yuan for three, five, 10 and 20 answers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A few years ago, I got curious, too. Cece told me I am a Leo sun, Aries moon and Sagittarius rising, and that is about all it did. Before speaking with Zhang, I was not aware things had evolved so much.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So I downloaded the app again and clicked on the cheapest option: 10 yuan for answers from four psychics. The system automatically generates popular questions such as “When will I get married?”, “Does he have feelings for me?”, “Can I pass the final exam?” and “Does my ex have a new girlfriend/boyfriend?”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I picked the last option. My ex and I had broken up a year earlier, and he has been in a newly committed relationship for seven months. It is a question to which I know the answer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Within minutes, I received four voice messages. After the usual astrological terms such as “Mercury and Leo in the ninth house”, two psychics told me “it’s likely that he’s talking to other girls”, while the other two said, “He has a romantic interest, but he’s definitely not in a new relationship” and “Your ex is currently single. He hasn’t got over you. He will take action towards you soon.”</p>In China, 16 per cent of those aged between 16 and 50 are willing to spend a minimum of 1,000 yuan per year on mysticism-related activitiesYuan Yulin, Gaorenhui CEO<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So there you go. For Zhang, too, the answers from Ask a Question were varied, but I started to think that the inconsistencies are what makes this feature a gateway drug, leading to the more addictive live streams, for which psychics can charge anywhere from 1.3 yuan to 23.3 yuan per minute.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Mysticism is a form of psychology and Cece aims at psychological counselling,” Cece’s CEO, Ren Yongliang, told media site Sohu News in March last year. According to him, top psychics on Cece can earn nearly 2 million yuan a year. “We’re building a tech company that makes counselling accessible for everyone.”</p>According to a survey conducted by Data Blog, a news site under Chinese tech giant NetEase’s 163 News, 80 per cent of the respondents under the age of 30 had explored mysticism, having talked to astrologers or <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">tarot readers</span></a>, online or in real life.On Weibo, as of September, #tarot had more than 11 billion views and #horoscope had reached over 175 billion views.

Four-minute videos with topics such as “reasons why Scorpios can’t get over their exes” have brought Taobaibai more than 20 million followers.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2016, Chinese investment firm Meisheng Holding Group acquired Uncle Tongdao for 210 million yuan and Cai cashed in 178 million yuan for his 72.5 per cent share.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The corporate takeover has put the name Uncle Tongdao on cafes, offline events and merchants. Taobaibai, meanwhile, could potentially earn 6 million yuan a month from his content, according to Sohu.</p>“In China, where the population has reached 1.4 billion, 16 per cent of those aged between 16 and 50 are willing to spend a minimum of 1,000 yuan per year on mysticism-related activities, [which makes online mysticism] a market worth 100 billion yuan,” says Yuan Yulin, the CEO of Gaorenhui, an online platform specialising in ancient Chinese divination text <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the I Ching</span></a>.The platform doesn’t provide guarantee for the experts.

On the app Cece Daren, any verified user can sign up for exams to become a counsellor. After two fundamental exams on the platform’s rules and ethics, prospective psychics can take tests in specialised subjects such as tarot reading, birth charts and the Yi Jing (I Ching).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aspirants are then required to film themselves using another device so examiners can check for any cheating. Despite the scrutiny, at some point the test banks for the online exams were leaked. On Xiaohongshu, posts and comments hinting at possession of “test banks for Cece” are common.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once certified, counsellors can live-stream and answer questions from the Ask a Question section. The prerequisites for becoming a higher-level counsellor are accumulated consulting hours, number of clients and at least two live streams per month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jia is a level-three psychic on Cece. She has been live-streaming for four hours every night from her apartment in Beijing for the past three years. Most of her clients are young women seeking clarity in relationships, she says, acknowledging that the quality of the psychics on Cece varies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The platform vets psychics based solely on online exams, and there are loopholes,” she says. “Some psychics say baseless and misleading stuff during live streams to keep the time running. They just want to accumulate minutes to jump to the next level.”</p>Even if the answers from the live streams are inaccurate, I can still dump my negativityZhang Qing<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In May, Zhang Qing, a 26-year-old woman from Zhejiang province who has spent nearly 100,000 yuan on Cece since 2020, recalled that some male psychic live-streamers made sexual jokes on a few occasions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But, she tells me, she has never thought of quitting because tuning into live streams at night has become part of her routine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her current favourite question is, “When will he ask me out again?” The dates provided by the psychics, though varied and not always accurate, give her hope.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After breaking up with my ex, I was very emotional,” she says. “Talking to the psychics on Cece has been a consolation. It’s impossible to spill to your friends all the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even if the answers from the live streams are inaccurate, I can still dump my negativity.
