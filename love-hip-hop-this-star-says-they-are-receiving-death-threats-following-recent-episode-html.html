Mena’s alleged actions in a most recent episode were controversial and the television personality says she has received death threats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-981695848.jpg><h2>Erica Mena on ‘Love & Hip Hop’ in the early years</h2><p id=par-2_60>Mena first appeared in the franchise as a supporting cast member on the second season of Love & Hip Hop: New York. After that, she was promoted to a main cast member for the third season. She remained a main cast member through the fifth season. Mena left <a href=#>the franchise</a> after that and did not return until 2017.</p><p id=par-3_33>She came back on a different series, joining Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta as a cast member for its seventh season. Mena then returned to the New York series for its tenth season.</p><p id=par-4_76>Mena was first introduced as a rival of Kimbella Vanderhee’s and they had one of the first violent fights in the show’s history. She then entered a relationship with her manager, Rich Dollaz. That dissolved and she then started dating Cyn Santana. When they broke up, she began a relationship with rapper Bow Wow. She refused to appear in the season five reunion special and later said that the season would be her last one.</p><p id=par-5_43>A few months later, she and Bow Wow ended things. Once she joined the franchise for the Atlanta series, her storyline mostly chronicled her feud with Stevie J as she tried to steer her Estelita Quintero away from him as her manager.</p><p id=par-6_26>Now, back on the New York series, she is now in a relationship with Safaree Samuels and her storyline chronicles their wedding and her pregnancy.</p><h2>What happened on the most recent episode</h2><p id=par-7_73>The most recent episode of Love & Hip Hop: New York showed a scene where it was said that Erica was trying to hook up Joe Budden (the ex-boyfriend of her ex, Cyn Santana) with his ex-girlfriend, Tahiry Jose. Though Santana and Mena had a very bad split that was documented on the show years ago, they seemed to be on better terms. Now, Santana is very upset at Mena’s supposed actions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-8_60>“Joe is a grown man. Whoever Joe loves, he gon’ be with. I’m just hurt and I’m like, appalled at Erica. We loved and cared for each other once upon a time but all of a sudden, Cyn and Joe are no longer together and Erica&nbsp;is so invested in putting him back with his ex?” said Santana in the episode.</p><p id=par-9_31>Mena and Santana eventually sat down about the matter and could not come to an understanding. After disagreeing about Mena’s impact and intent, the conversation halted and Santana walked out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Erica Mena says she’s getting threats</h2><p id=par-10_31>Mena sent out many tweets addressing the episode and responding to viewers who were critical of her behavior. She said that the editing of the episode only showed certain things.</p><p id=par-11_59><a href=#>She tweeted in part</a>, “I understand how it looks. But when will y’all understand editing is going to show you what it wants to show you. Certain people celebrated at my baby shower for a reason. And that scene from last night was one of them. If I was really all these things why am I ALWAYS blessed?”</p><p id=par-12_40>After going back and forth with several fans, she opened up and said that she was receiving death threats and alluded to a lot of the storyline being played up for television because this is a job to them.</p><p id=par-13_48>“At this end of the day this is a television show. And to be receiving death threats off [sic] this is completely disgusting. No one is perfect but we all are great at our job. To threaten someone because they get their job done is sick,” <a href=#>she said</a>.</p><p id=par-14_10>Love & Hip-Hop: New York airs Mondays on VH1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5sMLEZp%2BiqF2dvLF506GgrGWjqa6zedKasKxlpJ2yunnAq5xmqpWYsqrCyKeeZpyVlsGpedOhqZ6ZpKh6p7vLpaawoZ6cerOxwp6lrWWVpba0u8OeZaGsnaF8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flove-hip-hop-this-star-says-they-are-receiving-death-threats-following-recent-episode-html.html&text=This%20Star%20Says%20They%20Are%20Receiving%20Death%20Threats%20Following%20Recent%20Episode&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flove-hip-hop-this-star-says-they-are-receiving-death-threats-following-recent-episode-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flove-hip-hop-this-star-says-they-are-receiving-death-threats-following-recent-episode-html.html&title=This%20Star%20Says%20They%20Are%20Receiving%20Death%20Threats%20Following%20Recent%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flove-hip-hop-this-star-says-they-are-receiving-death-threats-following-recent-episode-html.html&title=This%20Star%20Says%20They%20Are%20Receiving%20Death%20Threats%20Following%20Recent%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flove-hip-hop-this-star-says-they-are-receiving-death-threats-following-recent-episode-html.html&title=This%20Star%20Says%20They%20Are%20Receiving%20Death%20Threats%20Following%20Recent%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flove-hip-hop-this-star-says-they-are-receiving-death-threats-following-recent-episode-html.html&description=This%20Star%20Says%20They%20Are%20Receiving%20Death%20Threats%20Following%20Recent%20Episode" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jerry-dixon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jerry Dixon dating?
