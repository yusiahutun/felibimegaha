The future king and Rose Hanbury made headlines back in 2019 due to several rumors about cheating.</p><p>Rose Cholmondeley (née Hanbury) is the wife of David Cholmondeley (pronounced Chumley), 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley. A Marquess (and his wife, a Marchioness) holds the fourth most senior rank in the British nobility (behind King/Queen, Prince/Princess, and Duke/Duchess). The Cholmondeleys are particularly notable, however, as they are hereditary co-holders of the office of Lord Great Chamberlain.</p><p>David was named King Charles’ Lord-in-Waiting meanwhile their son, Oliver, was named as one of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1006610/who-is-rose-hanbury/>king’s pages</a>, who was tasked with holding the robes of the king, alongside Prince George on Coronation Day. The couple also share another son, Alexander—Oliver’s twin—and daughter Iris. Not only is Rose connected to the royal family through her friendship with Kate, but her grandmother, Lady Elizabeth Lambert, was a bridesmaid at Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip’s wedding in November 1947.</p><p>Though Buckingham Palace swiftly put Prince William’s alleged affair and Rose Hanbury rumors to rest, netizens were quick to examine evidence from past drama to apply to the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1702058/what-abdominal-surgery-kate-middleton/>current situation</a> with the Princess of Wales.
