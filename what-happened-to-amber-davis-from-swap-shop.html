Amber was a beloved member of her community—a devoted wife and friend, a savvy business owner with a strong network, and a sweetheart who had battled kidney issues in the past. In fact, it was in December 2020, after filming had finished for the first season of Swap Shop, that Amber headed to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville for a kidney transplant surgery.</p><p>Nirvana Comics posted a photo of the brunette beauty in her hospital gown on December 5, to let fans know she was going into surgery and wouldn’t be around the shop for a few weeks.</p><p>The poster also asked that supporters keep her in their thoughts and prayers since she finally had a kidney on the way.</p><p>Sadly, the surgery led to complications for Amber, and she passed away some time later.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Are Shelia Eddy and Rachel Shoaf still friends</a>?</p><h2><strong>Amber Davis and her legacy</strong></h2><p>Nirvana Comics’ social media channels stayed quiet about their beloved Amber’s passing, but Garin took to Instagram with a small update on October 15, 2021, to honor her 39th birthday.</p><p>Amber’s husband may have chosen to stay silent on the matter publicly, but he took to Instagram in July of 2022 to say a few words about Amber and pay tribute to her savvy as a business owner, leader, founder, and friend.</p><p>In the post, he shared that she “created many of the things we take for granted here,” and to acknowledge that “Though she is gone from this Earth we feel her presence everyday.”</p><p>The business, which is known by fans to do things a little differently, chooses to honor its fallen founder through “benevolence, investing countless hours to make things fun.”</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Why does Itachi keep his arm out of his cloak</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSapZKav26wwK%2BgrGWWp7yuedKwmKllo528sXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-amber-davis-from-swap-shop.html&text=What%20happened%20to%20Amber%20Davis%20from%20Swap%20Shop%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-amber-davis-from-swap-shop.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-amber-davis-from-swap-shop.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Amber%20Davis%20from%20Swap%20Shop%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-amber-davis-from-swap-shop.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Amber%20Davis%20from%20Swap%20Shop%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-amber-davis-from-swap-shop.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Amber%20Davis%20from%20Swap%20Shop%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-amber-davis-from-swap-shop.html&description=What%20happened%20to%20Amber%20Davis%20from%20Swap%20Shop%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-kate-spade-her-husband-and-daughter-in-sorrow.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened To Kate Spade?
