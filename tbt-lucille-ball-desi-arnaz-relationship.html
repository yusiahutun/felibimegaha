Ball was told she was being considered for a role in the upcoming screen adaptation of the musical.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The show was a hit due in part to its breakout star: Desi Arnaz. "I recognized the kind of electrifying charm that can never be faked: star quality," Ball remembered of first seeing Arnaz on stage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Then Desi opened his mouth and began talking in his own peculiar brand of broken English, and a great belly laugh burst out of me," she went on. "Here was a stunning-looking male who was not only thrilling but funny. What a combination!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a>, Ball described meeting Arnaz as "true love from the start."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ball was ultimately cast in the 1940 adaptation of Too Many Girls alongside Arnaz.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dezi Arnaz, Lucille Ball.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>LMPC via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You could tell the sparks were flying with Lucy," the pair's co-star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Eddie Bracken said years later</a>. "It happened so fast it seemed it wouldn't last. Everybody on the set made bets about how long it would last."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the end of the year, Arnaz and Ball had agreed to elope in Greenwich, Conn. In the spur of the moment decision, Arnaz had neglected to buy Ball a ring — and, thus, the musician's business manager was tasked with running to Woolworth's to pick out a brass one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Although Desi later gave me a platinum ring, that little discolored brass ring rested among the diamonds and emeralds in my jewel case for years," Ball said in her memoir. She described marrying Arnaz as "one of the boldest things I ever did."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dezi Arnaz, Lucille Ball.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Bettmann/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like Bracken and the couple's other Too Many Girls castmates, Ball herself didn't think the marriage would last long: "I gave it a week."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> If there's anything Arnaz and Ball deserve to be celebrated for, it's redefining social norms. They weren't your typical Hollywood couple: Ball was nearly six years older than her husband (a gap so taboo at the time that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she reportedly lied about her birth year on their marriage certificate</a>); Arnaz was Cuban. (Bear in mind: This was the '50s.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Ball was approached about moving her radio show My Favorite Husband to television (which would of course become I Love Lucy), she fought for Arnaz to play her husband. It was hard won: there weren't interracial couples on TV at the time, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>executives reportedly bristled at Arnaz's accent</a>. Arnaz and Ball then went on tour with a Vaudeville act, its popularity proving to CBS that the couple's dynamic would resonate with audiences.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though, looking back, this casting was a historic feat, Ball's intentions hadn't been quite so grandiose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She wanted him [in the show] because she knew that if he went on the road with the band, he'd be catting around all the time," I Love Lucy writer Bob Weiskopf told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "She wanted him at home, where she felt the marriage would have a better chance of lasting."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Arnaz and Ball forever altered the television landscape once more in 1952, when Lucy's titular star got pregnant with her and Arnaz's second child. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The couple lobbied to have the pregnancy written into the show</a>, but were once again met with some serious pushback. An onscreen pregnancy had only happened once before — in Mary Kay and Johnny four years prior — and both the network and its sponsors were adamant that you <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>"cannot show a pregnant woman on television."</a> Though they were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>forbidden from using the word pregnant on screen</a>, Arnaz and Ball prevailed, and Little Ricky's birth (which aired the same day Desi Jr.'s actual birth) was watched by 44 million people (as in, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>72% of TV-owning homes tuned in</a>).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> Arnaz and Ball went through a lot together, but their love for one another never faltered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Amy Poehler's Prime Video documentary Lucy and Desi, the couple's daughter Lucie Arnaz shared details about her parents' heartfelt final goodbye.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I could hear her say, 'I love you.' She said it five times in a row. And he was nodding and saying, 'I love you too, honey,'" she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> of Ball's visit to her ex-husband's deathbed. "None of us realized it at the time, but the day they last spoke was Nov. 30, their wedding anniversary."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They gave the country this wonderful creation, but they never got what they wanted — to stay together," Arnaz went on. "... [But] they loved each other until the end."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong> Arnaz and Ball's relationship was never mirrored in that of the Ricardos' — but Ball liked to pretend it was.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was always happy in our story," she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Barbara Walters in 1977</a>. "It was always happy pretending. I had to pretend, but it helped."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Arnaz had a reputation as a philanderer, and Ball knew it well. In 1955, popular tabloid <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Confidential magazine published an issue with a scathing coverline</a>: "Does Desi Really Love Lucy?" Inside, the publication detailed Arnaz's illicit dealings with "cuddle-for-cash babes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ball's former publicist, Charles Pomerantz, recalled sharing the issue with his client. "I gave an advance copy to Desi, and Lucy said, 'I want to read this story.' It was during a rehearsal day, and she went into her dressing room," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "Everybody was frozen on the set. She finally came out, tossed the magazine to Desi and said, 'Oh, hell, I could tell them worse than that.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Weiskopf opined in the same People article, Arnaz didn't seem to understand what the problem was. "Basically, Desi's attitude was, 'What the hell's the matter? I love her. When I go out with women, they're usually hookers. Those don't count.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She told me that by 1956 it wasn't even a marriage anymore," biographer Bart Andrews told People. "They were just going through a routine for the children. She told me that for the last five years of their marriage, it was 'just booze and broads.' That was in her divorce papers, as a matter of fact."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After nearly 20 years of marriage, Ball filed for divorce in 1960. "It got so bad that I thought it would be better for us not to be together," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>she said in court</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>sit down with Walters in 1977</a>, Ball explained why her marriage to second husband Gary Morton worked better than her marriage to Arnaz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's not a loser," Ball said of Morton. "I married a loser before. He could win win high high high stakes, he could work very hard, he was brilliant, but he had to lose … Everything he built he had to break down."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There've been no games being played," she went on. "I was pretty used to a lot of games, and I'm not talking about Scrabble."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But through it all, the love remained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lucy loved Desi till the day she died," comedian Jack Carter, who introduced Ball to her second husband, told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>."There was a great, great love there," I Love Lucy director William Asher echoed. "Desi was very unhappy about the breakup, and I think she was too. I don't think either one of them ever got over it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the divorce, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Arnaz sold Ball his shares in their production company</a>, Desilu Productions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1963, he married Edith Hirsch, with whom he remained until her death in 1985. Arnaz passed away in Decemeber 1986 following a battle with lung cancer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ball resurrected Lucy several times after the sitcom's end, first as a widow in The Lucy Show (1962-1968) and then in Here's Lucy (1968-1974) — her and Arnaz's two children (Lucie and Desi Jr.) appeared in both spinoffs. In 1986, America's favorite housewife returned to the small screen once more in the short-lived series Life with Lucy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She and Morton married in 1961 and spent the next 28 years together. Ball died of a ruptured aorta following open-heart surgery in 1989.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Arnaz and Ball's story is explored in documentary Lucy and Desi, which launches on Prime Video March 4.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT: Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9Obq2akpZi2rbjEZpmapJxisaa%2FyGaYq6aRr3qzscuaq6Knnqi1qrw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftbt-lucille-ball-desi-arnaz-relationship.html&text=Lucille%20Ball%20and%20Desi%20Arnaz&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftbt-lucille-ball-desi-arnaz-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftbt-lucille-ball-desi-arnaz-relationship.html&title=Lucille%20Ball%20and%20Desi%20Arnaz" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftbt-lucille-ball-desi-arnaz-relationship.html&title=Lucille%20Ball%20and%20Desi%20Arnaz" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftbt-lucille-ball-desi-arnaz-relationship.html&title=Lucille%20Ball%20and%20Desi%20Arnaz" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftbt-lucille-ball-desi-arnaz-relationship.html&description=Lucille%20Ball%20and%20Desi%20Arnaz" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./music-forward-adds-student-program-to-jmblya-festival.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Music Forward Adds Student Program To JMBLYA Festival">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./530689-kenyan-travel-agency-offers-viral-nanny-ksh-30k-job-student-sponsorship-canada-visa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kenyan Travel Agency Offers Viral Nanny KSh 30k Job, Student Sponsorship Canada Visa">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
