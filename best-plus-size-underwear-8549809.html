If you’re in an uncomfortable pair, something that digs, chafes, or pulls, you’ll spend every waking minute wishing you weren’t. If you’re in something great, though — something that makes you feel comfortable, sexy, and put together — then you can sail through the day unafflicted, and perhaps even a bit more confident.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding a great pair of plus-size underwear can be a bit of a challenge, though. You have to find a pair that fits your body, in a style that you like, and a cut that you feel great wearing. It’s no easy task, especially when plus-size undies are still not nearly as prevalent as they should be in the marketplace.&nbsp;That’s why we went on a quest and consulted fashion underwear experts about what they think the best plus-size underwear is and why. Find all of the answers, ahead, along with advice on what to look for in a good pair of drawers for your next shopping spree.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-parade-vintage-high-rise-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Parade Vintage High Rise Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1434 data-sizes=750px alt="Parade Vintage High Rise Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wLVES5O9-ck3KghR-1T5z76OISc=/fit-in/1500x1434/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/parade-plus-size-brief-a2e411e105fa4a518d76080285229235.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Parade</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s breathable, flattering, and comes in all sorts of cool colors and patterns.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It only comes in sizes up to 3X.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What makes a good pair of underwear? For plus-sized consumers, it’s all sorts of things, from quality fabric to durability and style. Parade — a somewhat recent entrant into the underwear game that’s taken the internet by storm — offers all those things in spades, especially when it comes to their Vintage High Rise Brief.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a fairly high waist and fairly high-cut legs, these Vintage Briefs are both supportive and flattering, offering moderate butt coverage while still sitting right at your natural waist. They’re breathable, so you can wear them even if you have sensitive skin, and they’re comfortable under anything from jeans to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a skirt</a>. Plus, they come in a handful of colors and patterns, from basic black to vivid red.&nbsp;While they only come in sizes up to 3X, some Parade shoppers say these run a little big, so even customers who typically size larger could give them a try. Who doesn’t want a little comfort, after all?&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Tencel lyocell, Tencel x Refibra, elastane | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–3XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-lane-bryant-no-show-full-brief-panty></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lane Bryant No Show Full Brief Panty</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lane Bryant No Show Full Brief Panty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kcO2AtOPn95Q2fWp6OgSsoCsNHM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lane-Bryant-No-Show-Full-Brief-Panty-76a01f329dd24d6c90d109290841cfd4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lane Bryant</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These underpants are supportive and stylish at the same time.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Mostly nylon construction means they’re not very airy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of Lane Bryant’s best-selling pairs of panties, the No Show Full Brief is popular for a reason. The full-coverage brief has a flat, fairly wide stay-put elastic waistband, meaning it won’t show under your clothes. It also has leg openings and seams built with plus-sized customers in mind, meaning you won’t find yourself painfully constricted, no matter your size.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They’re machine-washable, which is great, and they come in a whole range of colors, styles, and patterns, many of which change with the seasons. Also, they’re readily available at most of the outlet’s stores, meaning that if you’re on a vacation somewhere and happen to need a pair of underpants, it probably won’t be that big of a stretch to just head in and snag one — a convenience that, frankly, isn’t always afforded to plus-size customers in most stores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex | <strong>Size: </strong>14/16–38/40</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cotton-lively-cotton-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lively Cotton Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lively Cotton Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NFaxj3XLQaEL2rcOkrV3FpE4QXA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lively-Cotton-Brief-acdf9c4c34a24fa2951e385c94f98d43.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lively</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Who doesn’t love a good cotton brief?

That’s probably because, when they were growing up, cotton underwear meant ill-fitting multi-packs of Underoo briefs bought at a big box store. Cotton underpants were boring, too big, and didn’t feel sexy at all.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These days, though, cotton panties can be comfortable, sexy, and stylish, meaning that sensitive wearers or those who just like a good plant-based product won’t have to sacrifice anything to get the look and fit they want. Beyond all of that, the concept of a pair is just classic. Enter Lively’s Cotton Brief, which offers a full-coverage look that moves with the body, sits right above the hip, and is entirely breathable. It comes in basic black, white, and a fairly chic black and white stripe, and though it’s not available in an incredibly wide range of sizes, the brand says its XXXL cut should fit up to a 24.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, spandex | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XXXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sweat-wicking-bali-comfort-revolution-microfiber-brief></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sweat-Wicking</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BALI Comfort Revolution Microfiber Brief</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bare Necessities BALI Comfort Revolution Microfiber Brief" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XfS-xZs3FDkYYsIotXNSs6zOv7s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bali-comfort-revolution-microfiber-brief-6894738a8629443caa81f7f420a2bf1f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bare Necessities</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The patented Cool Comfort fabric helps wick moisture away from the body.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>“Barely there” feel can be unsettling at first.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bali’s Comfort Revolution Microfiber Brief offers a four-way stretch for maximum comfort, as well as a patented fabric blend that helps wick moisture away from the body, meaning you’ll stay cool and dry no matter how hot it is outside. The briefs’ light-as-air feel might seem a little weird at first, especially if you’re used to rocking cotton or more sturdy, supportive underwear, but if you’re a sweaty person — or if you just sweat when you’re working out — then you’ll love these.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Based on the color of the briefs you pick — there are over 10 options — you’ll either get a knit-in or wide lace waistband on your underpants, both of which help keep these little beauties right where they belong.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon | <strong>Size: </strong>7–11</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-period-thinx-modal-cotton-lace-high-waisted-underwear></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Period</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Thinx Lace High Waisted Underwear</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Thinx Modal Cotton Lace High Waisted Underwear" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/boYHz96VULwrm1IJZgWp3tGCFyc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Thinx-Modal-Cotton-Lace-High-Waisted-Underwear-c610161bd220401b9caaae7ccdec59dd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Thinx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You’ll never have to worry about period leakage again if you’re wearing these.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re more expensive than other period-friendly options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Period underwear has popped off in the past ten or so years, going from a kind of quirky entrant into the women’s market to something that almost every major underwear manufacturer makes, all with varying degrees of success.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Still, Thinx was one of the first makers of period underwear and the brand is still around — and popular — for a reason. The panties are comfortable, reliable, and come in a fairly decent range of sizes and colors. The Modal Cotton Lace high-waisted underwear has a sort of retro ’50s flair that summons up Marilyn Monroe while also offering wearers a lot of absorbency. In fact, with a four out five drops rating on the Thinx scale, these panties can allegedly hold about four tampons worth of blood, a figure that’s both staggering and comforting. And while they’re a little more expensive than a regular old pair of underpants off the shelf at Target, you won’t have to buy pads or tampons anymore, so you’re not only saving a little bit of money, you’re also doing your part to save the Earth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Supima cotton, Tencel modal, elastane | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–4X</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-maternity-bodily-all-in-panty></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Maternity</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bodily All-In Panty</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bodily All-In Panty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OWww4LZWKeKOQ48ltuD6Z02BimU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bodily-All-In-Panty-8fd3983733a34d808d30f8ded1d77b13.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bodily</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These ultra-stretch underwear can be worn during and after pregnancy, making them a cost-effective buy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re not the sexiest underpants in the world, but does that even matter?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You don’t really realize when you get pregnant just how much stuff you’re going to need to buy. There’s all the stuff for the baby, sure, but there’s also all the stuff for you, from stretch mark cream to wider shoes. Some of that stuff you might be able to scrape together from friends who have already been through the experience, but you’re going to want to pony up for your maternity underwear, especially if it’s the Bodily All-In Panty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A high-waisted, full-coverage panty that’s super soft and stretchy, the All-In can be worn when you’re pregnant and even after you’ve given birth. The fabric feels cool on your skin even after a C-section, and the low-cut thigh means that you won’t be uncomfortable or overly cinched when you sit down.

They ride up a little on the butt, making them just a hint more racy than practical — but they also cover a good portion of the wearer’s abdomen, potentially up until just under your belly button, depending on your body’s size and shape.

Bloomers Knickerboxer Lace Boyshorts fall somewhere in the middle, offering the fit and security of a bigger boyshort with the sex appeal and style of whatever racy little number you might have saved in the back of the drawer.

Your postpartum body goes through it, too, moving and shifting into whatever your new body looks like. Motherhood Maternity’s Postpartum Essentials Support Underwear is designed to help ease that transition along, offering a soft, C-section-friendly waistband and front panel, but also a medium degree of compression and support, meaning you can sort of guide your slightly deflated belly back into its (somewhat) original shape.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because they’re seamless, they're less likely to give you visible panty lines (VPL), and they’re wildly comfortable — something that’s pretty crucial given how many weird and uncomfortable things happen in and around your body both during and after pregnancy.

Gradually over time, the brand has expanded to cover all sorts of sizes from 00 to 40, but given its expertise with all sorts of builds and bodies, it’s fair to say that you can put a little more trust in the options than you might in a company who merely dabbles in anything over an XL.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s why we were thrilled when we heard Universal Standard was creating an intimates collection, UltimateS. These well-made basics are great for all types of bodies, made from a cotton jersey-modal blend that feels very light. The High Rise Thong is great because it offers wearers a good amount of front coverage and the racy “no underwear” look in the back, giving you the best of both worlds. It’s the perfect choice for those who might want to dabble in thongs but hate how low-rise or revealing they can be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Lenzing modal, cotton, elastane | <strong>Size:</strong> 00–40</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-almost-thong-dreamgirl-high-waisted-lace-panty></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Almost Thong</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dreamgirl High Waisted Lace Panty</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Walmart Dreamgirl High Waisted Lace Panty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/M29PgwCMUewExwUTGIeG7HMumJY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dreamgirl-High-Waisted-Lace-Panty-e1960dac02d94088930265383bcdf96a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These are essentially lingerie, and we’re okay with that.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Certain colors and fits are occasionally hard to find, especially in popular plus sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dreamgirls’ most popular panty last year, according to fashion designer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Jenny Han</a>, this High Waisted Lace Panty is seductive and slinky.

That’s why when buying underwear you should look for both style and substance, fit and fashion. That’s especially true for plus-sized customers, who sometimes get the short end of the stick when it comes to garment fit. According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lori Pressler,</a> an intimates buyer at Macy’s, most reputable underwear manufacturers generally try to design their underwear by testing them out on differently sized models. That way they can see if, say, the gusset that works for someone that’s a size two needs to be tweaked a little when dealing with someone who’s a size 12 or a size 22. That being said, if you’re concerned about your underwear’s fit, then you should stick to brands you know and trust, or that you’ve read good things about from reputable sources. In the age of the internet, there are plenty of “plus-size” fashions and sizes out in the world (and on Amazon) that, really, are anything but once you get them on.</li><li><strong>Material: </strong>Pressler recommends that plus-sized customers seek out seamless fabric and a stretch waistband if they’re looking for that “second skin” stretch. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kate Bellman</a>, Editorial Content Director at Nordstrom, recommends prioritizing stretch, durability, and the quality of the product. “Within underwear specifically, stretch is key so that the underwear does not feel snug or uncomfortable on the seams and outside edges. A cotton gusset is also essential when buying underwear for breathability and sanitization purposes,” she says</li><li><strong>Silhouette: </strong>Han put together a handy reference list explaining most of the styles on the market today, which can be handy for anyone planning on heading to the store. As she explains, “Briefs provide good support and minimal coverage and are great for everyday wear, especially under tight-fitting clothing. Thongs are great for avoiding VPL under form-fitting clothing. They’re also great for special occasions but not the most comfortable option for everyday or physical activities. Sports and performance underpants offer moisture-wicking properties, support, and reduce chafing. They’re great for working out. High-waisted underpants are great for extra support and coverage and they’re great to wear every day, especially under <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>dresses</a> and skirts. G-strings are designed to minimize VPL and provide a no-show appearance, and they’re best for special occasions or romantic occasions. Crotchless panties have an open crotch designed for intimate or romantic occasions and are not intended for everyday wear, while boyshorts have great rear coverage and are very popular for everyday wear and versatility.”</li><li><strong>Variety: </strong>There’s something to be said for creating a sort of capsule collection of underwear in your drawers at home. You might like briefs for everyday use, but perhaps you could think about picking up a thong for special occasions, silhouettes, or nights on the town. Tired of wearing the same underwear to bed, to work, and to the gym? Consider switching up your routine and grabbing something moisture-wicking for a workout or something breezy and breathable for bedtime.</li><li><strong>Availability: </strong>Having the foresight to order all your internet online weeks in advance of when you’re going to need or want them is great, but how often does that happen? It’s more likely that you’re going to realize you need more underpants ASAP and that’s when you’ll end up popping for something cheap, nearby, and that gets the job done well enough.&nbsp;The fashion experts suggest that you keep a brand or style availability in mind when buying. Chantelle and Natori are Nordstrom customer-favorite brands that offer one-size-fits-all panties that make it easy for our customers to shop, Bellman says. They come in multiple silhouettes such as thongs, briefs, high-waist thongs, boyshorts, and hipsters, with a year-round three-for-$48 buy and save program, meaning that if you’re all of the sudden in need of some new underwear before you head off on spring break with your buds, it won’t be that hard to replenish your stock if you’ve chosen something dependable and available.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should you wash your underwear?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a general rule, all our fashion experts say that you should wash your underwear every single time you wear it, if only for hygiene’s sake. As Han explains, washing every time, “will prevent buildup of bacteria,” though she notes that it’s “important to follow the care instructions on [each pair] to avoid damaging them” and recommends using both a mild detergent and a lingerie bag. If you can, hand washing lacy or silky underwear is a good idea as well.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Marah Eakin</a>, the author of this article, has been a journalist reporting on entertainment, fashion, and culture for almost 15 years.
