Here’s what happened:</p><p>It all started when Hammond was driving his black Mercedes Benz SUV downtown, and he stopped in front of the Moxy Hotel on Southwest Alder, partly blocking traffic with his engine running.</p><p>Ryan Martin, in a gray Toyota Tundra, pulled up behind Hammond. The two drivers got into a heated exchange, making rude gestures at each other.</p><p>Martin then drove around Hammond and stopped on the other side of the intersection. He got out of his vehicle and walked back towards Hammond.</p><p>At this point, Hammond started loading a gun when he saw Martin approaching, even though he knew Martin was unarmed. Martin tapped on Hammond’s car window, and witnesses reported hearing shouting.</p><p>Hammond rolled down his window and shot Martin in the chest. Martin pleaded for his life, but Hammond tried to shoot him again, and his gun jammed.</p><p>A video showed this horrifying scene going on for a minute while Martin lay wounded and Hammond struggled with his gun. At one point, Hammond flashed something like a badge and made a disturbing comment.</p><p>Meanwhile, a man named Sam Gomez, who had been attending a conference at the Moxy Hotel, recorded the events on his phone from about 15 feet away. Hammond managed to fix his gun and shot Gomez in the leg, then drove away, firing another shot that missed.</p><p>Hammond called 911 while heading towards the county courthouse and admitted to shooting both men. He believed he was justified because he felt threatened by Martin and suspected Gomez might have a weapon.</p><p>Hammond turned himself in at the parking garage across from the courthouse and, during an interview with investigators, confessed to the shootings, claiming he knew Martin was unarmed and expressing little remorse. He also mentioned he believed people were stalking him.</p><p>Despite his justifications, no witnesses reported seeing anything that could have justified the use of deadly force. Tragically, Martin lost his life, while Gomez is expected to recover.</p><p>Hammond is now facing serious charges, including second-degree murder with a firearm, attempted second-degree murder with a firearm, first-degree assault with a firearm, and two counts of unlawful weapon use.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Dr Derrick Todd Wiki, Age, Wife, Kids, Net Worth and More</a></p><p><img decoding=async title="Geoffrey Hammond on coingeek backstage" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Geoffrey-Hammond-on-coingeek-backstage.webp alt="Geoffrey Hammond on coingeek backstage" width=400 height=504 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>What we Know About Geoffrey Hammond</strong></h2><p>Back in 2020, Geoffrey Hammond founded a financial company in Portland called Aequantium. This company dealt with managing funds invested in commodities futures and related securities.</p><p>Just a year later, in 2021, he got the chance to speak at the CoinGeek conference in New York, where he showcased his company to the audience.</p><p>You can still find clips of his presentation and an interview with Hammond on YouTube. Hammond also owns another business, Aequantium Research, which you can verify on the Oregon Secretary of State’s website.</p><p>Fast forward to May 2023, things took a turn. Hammond filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, revealing that he had around $34,000 in credit card debt, and he lost his job because his company closed down.</p><p>Interestingly, he owns a house in Portland’s West Hills worth $890,000, a 2020 Mercedes SUV, and four firearms, all detailed in court documents.</p><p>Adding more, federal bankruptcy filings suggest that Hammond once went by the name Jeffrey Edward Mandalis. Court records from Illinois show that Mandalis has a history involving charges of assault, vandalism, trespassing, and domestic battery.</p><p>Geoffrey Hammond is single and has no children. However, there are a couple of traffic tickets on his record in Multnomah County.</p><h3><strong>Geoffrey Hammond FAQs</strong></h3><p>Ques: What is Geoffrey Hammond’s age?</p><p>Ans: Geoffrey Edward is 47 years old.</p><p>Ques: Is Geoffrey Hammond’s married?</p><p>Ans: He did not disclose.</p><p>Ques: What was Geoffrey Hammond’s previous name?</p><p>Ans: Jeffrey Edward Mandalis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsr5WauG%2BvzqZmoJ2fm7Ozsdhmn5qlnaS7pXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeoffrey-hammond.html&text=Geoffrey%20Hammond%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife%2c%20Kids%20and%20More&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeoffrey-hammond.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeoffrey-hammond.html&title=Geoffrey%20Hammond%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife%2c%20Kids%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeoffrey-hammond.html&title=Geoffrey%20Hammond%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife%2c%20Kids%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeoffrey-hammond.html&title=Geoffrey%20Hammond%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife%2c%20Kids%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeoffrey-hammond.html&description=Geoffrey%20Hammond%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife%2c%20Kids%20and%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./monmouth-college-to-honor-alumni-1-family-at-homecoming.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Monmouth College to honor alumni, 1 family at Homecoming">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./19-mind-blowing-facts-about-james-randi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="19 Mind-blowing Facts About James Randi">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
