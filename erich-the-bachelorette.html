We know each other the best, our relationship above all is the most important. Plus a man that’s worth it isn’t going to have us fight over him, nor would we ever compromise our relationship for it.”</p><p>She continued, “It’s only natural to be attracted to the same guys, here and there. We’re human, but it would never be anything that Rachel and I couldn’t figure out on our own, especially always putting our relationship in the forefront of everything.”</p><p>As for how their season ends, Gabby and Rachel confirmed that they’re happy with the outcome. “I think we feel good honestly.

I would never, ever say who it is, especially without a warning, but I will confirm there will be two rings,” Zachary Reality said. For Gabby’s engagement, it’s almost certain that the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008.

I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><p>Before The Bachelorette season 19 finale, Gabby had Hometown Dates with her final three, which included: Erich, Jason and Johnny.

As of writing this, the answer is yes. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Steve</a>, Gabby and Erich are still together and engaged after The Bachelorette season 19 finale.. “As for Gabby and Erich, they are still together. Nothing new to report there. Whatever drama goes down in Mexico, it’s not like anyone else comes back for her. He’s the only guy left,” Reality Steve wrote in a blog post in September 2022. “They work through it and are together today.”</p><p>Gabby also confirmed she and Erich are still together in an interview with People after The Bachelorette season 19 finale. “There’s lots of excitement. There’s also some fear, because you don’t know what you’re really walking into,” she said. “It’s a whole new world post filming!” Gabby—who said she plans to move from Colorado to Los Angeles to be closer to Erich—told People that she and Erich had “lots of FaceTimes” and “lots of communication” while they had to keep their relationship a secret. She continued, “If there was an inkling of a worry or of a concern, you have to bring it up sooner rather than later for yourself, because your time is so limited together. You would address some things in person and then be together again. You get into more of a rhythm.”</p><p>Gabby also told People that she wished she could be there with Erich when he lost his father, Allan, to cancer in July 2022.&nbsp;“That was and still is a really hard time for Erich, and I just wanted to be as supportive as I could for him and his family,” she said. “It was hard to not be there in person and have to support from afar, for sure. It’s strengthened our communication and hopefully we’ll have a whole new part of our relationship to explore.” Gabby also confirmed her and Erich’s commitment to each other. “Our commitment to each other is there,” she said. “Now it’s just doing the hard work, which is getting to know each other, more communication, really strengthening those building blocks before we get to the altar.”</p><p><span>During the “After the Final Rose” special, Gabby and Erich addressed Erich’s ex-girlfriend A</span><span>manda Kaylor’s claims that they were still together when he went on </span>The Bachelorette<span> and that Erich told her that the show was “all acting” and he wanted to be a contestant for a “fresh start and a new career path.” Amanda also leaked texts between her and Erich seemingly confirming this. (More on that later.) </span><span>“I led her on and I want to own that. No hard feelings toward this girl at all. I understand her actions. … I didn’t want to have a hard conversation. But I’ve learned a lot from it. I want to own that 100 percent. I do not have any hard feelings for this girl. It’s a mistake I made on my part,” Erich said. He continued, </span><span>“I was using the show as an excuse to not confront her about our relationship. I didn’t see a future but we were having fun. … I love [Gabby] with all my heart. 100 percent real. I never expected it. I want this to be forever.”</span></p><p>Gabby confirmed Erich told her about Amanda before Erich’s ex-girlfriend’s claims went public. She also called him “gracious” and “honest” before joking that he was an “asshole.” She also confirmed that she forgave him. She also told People at the time, “I was expecting the text messages,” she said. “He was scared they were going to leak and I’m like, ‘You have to prepare yourself now and tell me the truth.’ And he did, so there’s not really anything I can say or do.”</p><p>She continued, “Ultimately it was a time for us to take a step back and reflect on our relationship and see if we can get through this,” Gabby says. “You have to really lead on your communication, be really honest with each other while having these tough conversations. We’re seeing how we can become better from both.”</p><p>The “After the Final Rose” special after Erich’s ex-girlfriend, Amanda Kaylor, claimed in a statement to the Instagram account <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@Bachelornation.Scoop</a> that they were still together when he went on The Bachelorette.&nbsp;Read the full statement below:</p><p>“After long debating ever telling anyone about my chapter with Erich, Ive decided to. He recently posted a well deserved apology for an unacceptable decision he made to Instagram. It took me back to another apology he made that I received from him this summer. This is in no way me comparing his inexcusable actions but rather to help shine light on his true character. When Erich and I had began dating it was quite the whirlwind romance, we were head over heels for each other, happiest I’d felt in a while. After a few months of amazing dates, adventures, countless sleepovers, I thought I had really found my person.”</p><p>“Erich had lost his job during this time and I could tell it weighed heavy on him & I tried to be there for him as he prepared for his interviews for new jobs. One morning after a normal night together I got a text after he left my place (march 10th) making jokes and telling me he got some news he wanted to talk to me about. I called him immediately. He told me he got a call and was offered to be a contestant on the bachelorette and I was in shook he would even consider this kind of gig while we were dating. He insisted that it was all acting and it would be as if he was just going out of town for a few weeks. He wanted a fresh start and a new career path because he was unhappy with his.”</p><p>“I knew that this wasn’t that this wasn’t a reality show I could handle ‘just waiting for him on the other side.’ I made it clear that was something I would not be okay with and he said he needed to think about what to do because it could open a lot of doors. I texted him after letting him know that if this was the decision he was making, best of luck but I stand by my decision not to stay. Ive attached the following screenshots of conversation that were had following this call. I mourned our relationship. I cried a ton and began to process that there was something better out there for me. Texts were still being exchanged between us about how sad we were to lose each other, but I knew I needed to move on.”</p><p>“Ten days later (march 22nd) I received two dozen roses at my door from Erich with a note saying I’ll never stop thinking about you. The texts following those roses are also attached but in short he says he went back home to think about everything couldn’t stop thinking about me and wanted to know if we could talk when he returned to LA. I decided to sleep on this because my heart was broken, but the next morning, the sucker I am agreed to meeting with him and texted him back. Little did I know he had already returned and left to film the show so my text went green.”</p><p>“It was hard to process that he could reopen a wound just to make the same choice, leaving me heartbroken once again. Once again, I mourned, healed, and moved on. I received a text from him (July 10th) as the show began to air, telling me how terrible what he did to me was and how sorry he was. That he thinks about me all the time and won’t ever forgive himself. Our chapter was over for me long before this and I saw this as a sad attempt to save himself from anything to harm his newfound fame and reputation. I don’t believe Erich had any good intentions going on this show and I don’t believe anything to have changed, he wanted the clout and he got it. I just hope he doesn’t continue to hurt anyone on this new path he is on.”</p><p>Amanda also shared texts from Erich around the time he was cast on The Bachelorette. “I got some news this morning that I need to talk to you about,” Erich texted. After calling Erich, Amanda texted him, “not sure how you expected me to feel but if that’s your decision, best of luck.” Erich responded, “I know this isn’t ideal, I wanted to do this to see if there was something else I could do with my life. I really like you Amanda. I didn’t think it would be a big deal, but I understand how you feel. I’m sorry and I understand if you don’t want to see me anymore.” Amanda texted back, “you expect me to continue dating you while you go on a reality <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>tv</a> show to ‘find love.'” Erich responded, “It isn’t real, but you’re right. I am sorry I really didn’t think this all through.” Amanda texted back, “So you drop something real for something fake got it..” Erich responded, “I didn’t realize the implications. I am sorry I thought we could get on the same page about this. I really didn’t mean for this to hurt you.”</p><p>Amanda texted back, “well I’m heartbroken, really hope you get all the fame and business opportunities you are looking for.” Erich responded, “I am not well Amanda. You make me happy, but I am deeply unhappy with myself. You are better off without me in the long run, trust me.” Amanda texted back, “You don’t get to tell me what I’m better off without. We are all unhappy with ourselves, but we have the choice to choose someone who makes us a better versuion of ourselves.” Erich responded, “You are right and I agree with you, but I don’t think I can be that for you. Not until I figure out who I am. Not that this is the answer, but I need to change. I’m stuck in my career path and I’m miserable with it. I don’t want this to be the rest of my life.”</p><p>When Erich returned from The Bachelorette in July 2022, Erich texted Amanda, “I am so sorry Amanda, what I did was terrible, I don’t expect you to ever forgive me. I just want you to know I think about you all the time and you really deserve the best. I won’t ever forgive myself I hope find happiness and everything you deserve.” Amanda also shared photos of her and Erich to confirm they were in a relationship.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Steve</a> in September 2022, Amanda revealed that she and Erich met in January 2022 on Hinge. Amanda is a single mom and Erich had spent time with both her and her son. She also claimed that Erich hung out with her and her son the last week before he left for The Bachelorette. Amanda also claimed that Erich had never mentioned The Bachelorette to her until their call in March 2022, two weeks before he left to film. Reality Steve believed that Erich had been in talks with ABC weeks before then but didn’t tell Amanda.</p><p>Amanda also believed that Erich’s text to her in July 2022, two months after he finished filming The Bachelorette in May 2022, was to “<span class=s2>soften the blow” for how he ended up with Gabby on The Bachelorette. “She understands that was not a text to try and win her back because there hadn’t been any contact from mid-May until then, and hasn’t been any contact since. That text was seemingly something to soften the blow for what was to come since he knew he’d ended up with Gabby, and she told me she believes it was all about making sure she didn’t say anything publicly. It didn’t make any sense to her otherwise why he would’ve sent what he did when he did,” Reality Steve wrote.</span></p><h2><span>SPOILER: Who does Rachel pick as </span>The Bachelorette<span> 2022 winner?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Rachel-The-Bachelorette-2022.jpg><p>Who does Rachel pick as The Bachelorette 2022 winner? Rachel’s Bachelorette 2022 winner is Tino Franco, a 27-year-old general contractor from Playa del Ray, California. Rachel and Tino are also engaged. Aven Jones, a 28-year-old sales executive from San Diego, California, came in second place and was eliminated in his hotel room before the the Final Rose Ceremony, which meant Tino was the only contestant at Rachel’s Final Rose Ceremony. Zach Shallcross, a 25-year-old tech executive from Anaheim Hills, California, came in third place and eliminated himself around the time of Fantasy Suites after a conversation with host, Jesse Palmer, according to Reality Steve.</p><p>“His conversation with Jesse in Mexico where Jesse is telling him he needs to tell Rachel the truth happens after his overnight date, and I can’t tell you the exact wording because I don’t know, but that’s essentially Zach eliminating himself,” Reality Steve wrote. “Whether it’s him telling Rachel he’s not ready, or that it’s too serious and he’s not there yet with her, like I said, don’t know his wording. But that convo with Jesse is a pre-cursor to Zach telling Rachel something that eliminates him at final 3.”</p><p>Tyler Norris, a 25-year-old small business owner from Wildwood, New Jersey, came in fourth place and is eliminated after Hometown Dates. Tyler is also on Bachelor in Paradise season 8, where he ends up with Brittany Galvin, a contestant from The Bachelor season 25 with Matt James. <span>Reality Steve also confirmed that </span>The Bachelorette<span> season 19 finale and Fantasy Suite dates were filmed Mexico.</span></p><p>Reality Steve also confirmed that The Bachelorette season 19 finale and Fantasy Suite dates were filmed Mexico. TikTok account <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@zacharyreality</a> also confirmed in July 2022 that both Rachel and Gabby get engaged in The Bachelorette season 19 finale. For Rachel’s engagement, it’s almost certain that the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008. In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Lane told <a href=# rel=noopener>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple to stays together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><p>Before The Bachelorette season 19 finale, Rachel had Hometown Dates with her final four: Aven, Tyler, Zach and Tino. Aven’s Hometown Date was filmed first on April 23, 2022, in Salem, Massachusetts. Tyler’s Hometown Date was filmed second on April 25, 2022, in Wildwood, New Jersey. Zach’s Hometown Date was filmed third on April 27, 2022, in Orange, California. Tino’s Hometown Date was filmed last on April 29, 2022, in Los Angeles, California. Each of Rachel’s Hometown Dates was filmed a day before Gabby’s.</p><p>For Rachel’s Hometown Date with Aven in Salem, Massachusetts, they went to the restaurant Finz and road a horse carriage to the magic store Crow Haven. For Rachel’s Hometown Date with Tyler in Wildwood, New Jersey, they visited the Wildwoods Boardwalk, where they played games and rode rides. For Rachel’s Hometown Date with Zach in Orange, California, they visited fire department and kissed in the front seat of a fire truck while in firefighter suits.

The answer is no. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Steve</a>, Rachel and Tino broke up and are no longer engaged. The decision came after Rachel accused Tino of cheating on her after The Bachelorette season 19 finale. “He’s never been like, ‘What I did was horrible, I messed up, I’m so sorry.’ It’s never been like that. It was just, ‘I love you so much, I really see you as my future, and I want us to work on this.’ That’s like if we just had a random fight,” Rachel said during the “After the Final Rose” special.</p><p>When Tino reunited with Rachel for the first time since their breakup, he confessed he “kissed” a woman he met before The Bachelorette started filming. “The moment I did [it], I knew I belonged with you,” he told Rachel. Tino then accused Rachel of refusing to go to therapy and wanting to give her engagement ring back. Tino also claimed he ddin’t want to “circle back on past stuff,” which is when Rachel accused him of doing more than kissing the other woman, which he denied.</p><p>Rachel told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> after The Bachelorette season 19 finale that she has no plans to get back together with Tino after he cheated on her. “I obviously still believe in love and I really know it’ll come along when it’s ready,” Rachel said. “I am looking forward to this time to myself and to be able to reflect on everything and move forward.” Rachel also told People that the main reason she ended her engagement with Tino wasn’t the infidelity but his dishonesty around it.&nbsp;“When I did sit down with him, I didn’t see much of him owning up to his actions or feeling sorry,” Rachel said. “I was still hitting lie after lie. And I just don’t know if I can continue a relationship when I don’t feel like there’s trust. I know that isn’t what I deserve.”</p><p>Rachel explained that she learned of Tino’s infidelity after he continued to bring up allegations against another contestant from The Bachelorette season 19 and concerns over leaked text messages. “I couldn’t figure out why he was bringing it up so much,” Rachel said. “And I really wanted to talk to him about what happened in previous relationships: ‘Is there anything you need to tell me?’ And he told me, ‘No.’ And shortly after going home from that happy couple visit, he did call me and I slowly worked out the details of some infidelity. It wasn’t something that he felt like he needed to tell me by any means. It was something I had to pull out.”</p><p>The conversation led Tino and Rachel to hit a “rough patch” where she asked for space but didn’t officially break up with him yet. “But there was never ever a point in which we called off a relationship, called off an engagement or we weren’t committed to each other in my mind,” Rachel said. When Tino confessed to cheating on her during that break, Rachel knew it was time to end the relationship for good. She also believed the infidelity lasted for longer than Tino told her. “I think, in my personal opinion, it was probably going on for longer,” she says. “I do believe that I don’t have the facts,” she said. Rachel also told People that she didn’t expect to end her engagement with Tino after he proposed to her at their Final Rose Ceremony. “When I said yes, I was accepting forever. That meant that we were going to be navigating this together,” she said. “We broke at the first crack in the glass, essentially. There really is no other way to look back at it, other than just hoping it’s something I can take and move forward.”</p><p>Rachel also credited her other season 19 Bachelorette, Gabbey Windey, for helping her “get in the right headspace” after her split from Tino.&nbsp;“It truly was honestly like a godsend for me,” Rachel said. “I really can’t thank her enough for being there for me. I am so thankful for her. I came in here with Gabby and I came out [with her]. I didn’t walk out with a love story that I necessarily hoped for — doesn’t mean I’m not walking out with all the love in the world at the end of the day.”</p><p>Before The Bachelorette season 19 finale, Reality Steve broke the news that Rachel and Tino had broken up after they had a “Ross and Rachel” situation from Friends, where there was a miscommunication over whether they were still together or on a break. Reality Steve also compared the situation to Ben Flajnik and Courtney Robertson from The Bachelor season 16. Reality Steve reported that, sometime after The Bachelorette season 19 finale, Rachel and Tino stopped talking but were still engaged. During a “Happy Couple” visit, which was caught on camera, Rachel and Tino had a fight over what he did while they were apart. “I want an answer for why you did, what you did,” Rachel tells Tino in a clip from the visit. Reality Steve also reported that Rachel and Tino haven’t spoken since the breakup and there isn’t a chance of a reconciliation at the “After the Final Rose” special.</p><p>“What I was told was that, well, her name is Rachel. And it’s kind of ironic because it somewhat resembles the Ross & Rachel situation from Friends. You know, the ‘We were on a break!’ ordeal. Not fully the same situation, but it’s close,” Reality Steve wrote in a blog post in September 2022. “Again, I don’t know if any cheating occurred and that’s what she’s questioning so please don’t make that your narrative. The Ross/Rachel reference is more about her name being Rachel, and I was told there was definitely some ambiguity in regards to what was happening in the relationship. But what I do know is her just even asking him that question came about because they were definitely at a weird point in their relationship where they were still engaged but weren’t talking.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reality Steve</a> gave more details on Rachel and Tino’s break up in another post in September 2022. Reality Steve reported that, sometime after The Bachelorette finished filming, there was a “lull” in Rachel and Tino’s relationship where they stopped talking and the “communication was poor.” “I was hearing something along the lines of a Ross/Rachel from Friends kinda deal,” Reality Steve wrote. After Rachel moved from Florida to Los Angeles, she told Tino that she wanted to give the engagement ring back and just date. Tino didn’t want to end the engagement, but didn’t tell Rachel that because he was scared to lose her, according to Reality Steve, who reported that the conversation was a turning point for Rachel and Tino’s relationship. Sometime after the conversation, Tino kissed another woman on a night out. “There wasn’t sex, and it wasn’t an ongoing thing. I only say that not to excuse it, because there is no excuse for cheating and breaking trust,” Reality Steve wrote. Reality Steve also reported that the woman Tino kissed wants nothing to do with his and Rachel’s relationship. “I tried to find out who the girl was. Was told she wants nothing to do with this story, so, I don’t know her relationship with Tino, if it was an ex, a random, or someone he knew from his past. He told her it was a one time kiss,” Reality Steve wrote.</p><p>After Tino told Rachel about the kiss on a “Happy Couple” visit, she ended their relationship. .”Was told Tino knows he screwed up, has apologized, but Rachel is checked out of the relationship,” Reality Steve wrote. “My guess based on what I heard is that if Rachel would’ve given it another chance at the time, Tino would want that, but he understood why Rachel made the decision she did. He broke her trust with his actions when he should’ve told her immediately. Not to mention he shouldn’t have cheated in the first place.”</p><h2><span>Who is the next Bachelor 2023?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Bachelorette-2022-Gabby.jpg><p>Who is the next Bachelor for 2023?

Davia graduated the University of South Carolina and was the Miss South Carolina in 2018 in the Miss America pageant. She competed with Cat. Davia’s mother died in 2013 of leukemia when she was in high school and her father remarried that year. According to Reality Steve, she then moved to Russia on a dance scholarship, where she struggled with an eating disorder, before coming back to the United States, entering pageants and winning the title of Miss South Carolina. Car also attended the University of South Carolina at the same time as Davia and competed against her for the title of Miss South Carolina in 2018.</p><p>But back to The Bachelor.

But after poking around a little bit, asking around, what I can tell you is: I don’t know who the Bachelor’s going to be, but you can cross Nate off the list. I have heard it is not him,” Reality Steve said. “I usually can’t get any details to stuff like that. I have heard, I have no idea if it’s true or not, but I have heard he rejected it, he doesn’t want to do it.” A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> in August 2022 that Nate was the frontrunner to become the next Bachelor.</p><p>The reports also came after Nate was photographed holding hands with a woman at a grocery store in Chicago, Illinois, in August 2022, weeks after he cried over his breakup with Gabby on The Bachelorette season 19 “Men Tell All” special. “Spotted Nate and another girl in Chicago today,” an anonymous source sent to the Instagram account @bachelorettewindmill <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">along with a photo</a>. “They were both holding hands so could be dating?”</p><p>Other season 19 Bachelorette contestants not in the running to be the Bachelor 2023 are: Tyler Norris (who ends up with season 25 Bachelor contestant Brittany Galvin on Bachelor in Paradise season 8) and&nbsp;Johnny DePhilippo (who gets engaged to season 24 Bachelor contestant Victoria Fuller on Bachelor in Paradise season 8). Erich Schwer, who gets engaged to Gabby in The Bachelorette season 19 finale, and Tino Franco, who gets engaged to Rachel, also aren’t in the running to be the Bachelor 2023. <span>Reality Steve also doesn’t believe that Logan Palmer, Ethan Kang, Spencer Swies, Aven Jones or Jason Alabaster from </span>The Bachelorette<span> season 19 will be the next Bachelor. According to Reality Steve, the one contestant from Gabby and Rachel’s </span>Bachelorette<span> season that does have a chance is Zach Shallcross.&nbsp;“It means we’re moving on to somebody else. I don’t know who from this season outside of maybe Zach. I don’t see it being Aven. I don’t see it being Logan. I don’t see it being Ethan. I don’t see it being Spencer. I don’t see it being Jason,” Reality Steve said.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Other Bachelor Nation alums who aren’t in the running to be the next Bachelor are The Bachelorette season 17 contestant Michael Allio (who ends up with season 21 Bachelor contestant Danielle Maltby on Bachelor in Paradise season 8) and The Bachelorette season 18 contestant Brandon Jones (who ends up with season 26 Bachelor contestant Serene Russell on Bachelor in Paradise season 8.)</p><p>While Nate isn’t the Bachelor 2023, Gabby told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in August 2022 that he was her number-one choice as the next lead. “Nate. 100 percent Nate, Nate, Nate!” she said. “He knows how to treat women. He’s so smart, he’s old, he has a great job, he spends his time reading—not reading social media, reading actual books. He has a daughter, so he knows what it’s like to have responsibility. He’s a real, true definition of a man.”</p><p>Rachel told Entertainment Tonight that her choices for the next Bachelor were Nate and Tyler. “From Gabby’s side I would say Nate, [he’s] incredible, and from my side, maybe Tyler. Who knows?” Rachel said. “They really couldn’t go wrong.” Mario Vassall, another contestant from The Bachelorette season 19, agreed with Rachel’s picks. “Nate, his name comes to mind… Nate is a fun, standup guy,” he said. “… I’m a big fan of Tyler Norris. We saw his breakup with Rachel. That was tough to watch. [I’m a] big fan of him, his character. He wears his heart of his sleeve. I wouldn’t be mad if he took that position.” Mario also confirmed that he’s open to becoming the next Bachelor in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a>. “I would say that I am open to the conversation,” he said.”Ad we’d go from there.”</p><p>Tyler, for his part, confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that he isn’t interested in becoming the season 27 Bachelor but would root for Nate if he became the next lead. “I couldn’t even imagine dating two women at the same time, let alone 30-something women, but then again, you can’t take anything out of the card,” he said. “My man, Nate, he’s the sweetest, most genuine guy. I would love to see him. He brings flair too… My man would do a great job.” Tyler also told E! News about his concerns over becoming the next Bachelor.&nbsp;“I would definitely say that it’s very hard to navigate,” Tyler said. “With 30-something women there, it would definitely be a tough job to have, without hurting somebody at the end of the day. [But] if it gets me a stop closer to ultimately finding love then absolutely I would do it.”</p><p>Host Jesse Palmer also voted for Nate.&nbsp;“Nate is a standup guy. He’s an amazing person. He’s mature, he has an incredible emotional maturity, he’s vulnerable, he respects women, and he’s a great dad,” Jesse said. “I there’s there’s very few negative things I can say about Nate.” Jesse also had another choice for the next lead. “Are we still saying Pete Davidson? Is that still a choice?” Jesse said. “… I wanna ride that train. Wanna talk about a wild Bachelor season? That would probably be it. We might have to change some of our parameters.”</p><p>Gabby and Rachel also voiced their support for two Bachelors like how there were two Bachelorettes on season 19. “We loved each other for it, and loved having one another by one another’s side,” Gabby said of her relationship with Rachel. “I don’t know if men would feel the same, it depends on their relationship, but I think there’s a lot of good to come out of our season.” Rachel added, “I think ultimately if the Bachelors supported each other and loved each other to the extent that Gabby and I do, it could be incredible as well, but they would definitely have to be on the same level as us. Lots to live up to, of course!”</p><p>Mario, however, was against the idea and told Entertainment Tonight that ABC should “absolutely not” have two Bachelors. Tyler also agreed with him. “I think watching back the two Bachelorette thing was a lot,” Tyler said. “Having two Bachelors would be the same thing. I think they should stick to one.”</p><h2><span>Who is </span>The Bachelorette<span> 2022, Gabby Windey?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Bachelorette-2022-Rachel.jpg><p>Who is The Bachelorette 2022, Gabby Windey? The Bachelorette season 19 leads are Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia from The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard. Gabby is a 31-year-old ICU nurse from O’Fallon, Illinois, who currently lives in Denver, Colorado. Her Instagram handle is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@gabriela.windey</a>. She was eliminated in the final three after Clayton chose Susie Evans—whom he eliminated the episode before but invited back to the show—as his winner, sending home both Gabby and Rachel. “I actually don’t know who you are at all. “I’m pissed because I spent the last two months away from my friends and family who actually give a shit about me, and you don’t,” Gabby told Clayton after he eliminated her. She continued, “You asked me to stay because you were pissed because Susie left and your pride was hurt.” She also added during the “After the Final Rose” special, <span>“Watching it back, everything is so muddled, and you are clearly pitting us against each other. It really seems like a competition, which I had expressed to you that I didn’t want to be a part of.”</span></p><p>So who is The Bachelorette 2022, Gabby Windey? Gabby listed her job on The Bachelor as an “ICU Nurse.”&nbsp;Gabby also worked as a registered nurse in the medical ICU at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital, according to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Linkedin</a>.&nbsp; In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Athletic</a> in 2020, Gabby opened up about what it’s like to work on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’re all leaning on each other, and it really becomes a new normal kind of fast,” she said. “All of health care is ever-changing because we’re always trying to make sure we’re doing things the best way, which comes with evidence-based practice and re-evaluating the way we’re doing things. So we are used to change. But it is hard and, of course, this is different because of the seriousness of it and how many people it’s affecting.”</p><p>She continued, “There is always kind of a thought and worry of working so close to it, there’s obviously a risk of transmission. But we have the suitable PPE and have been trained extensively how to take it on and off carefully so we don’t give it to ourselves while we’re taking it off. You have to be vigilant and you have to pay attention to what you’re doing at all times. “I haven’t had to reuse any other PPE, but putting it out there early on that we need to not be wasteful has really helped us now.”</p><p>Along with her job as an ICU nurse, Gabby is also a cheerleader for the Denver Broncos. In 2021, Gabby, who’s been cheering for the Denver Broncos since 2016, became the first woman to receive the Pop Warner Humanitarian Award, an honor usually given to football players. “Windey is the first female and NFL cheerleader in the history of the award, which has traditionally been awarded to NFL players,” Pop Warner Little Scholars said in a press release. (Kansas City Chiefs lineman Laurent Duvernay-Tardif also received the honor.) “Both Windey and Duvarney-Tardif’s selflessness and commitment to helping others are an embodiment of sacrifice and teamwork, making them model representatives for young student-athletes across the nation.”</p><p>In her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Bachelor bio</a>, Gabby described her dream man as someone who has a “quiet confidence.” “Gabby is much more than meets the eye. Not only is she beautiful, but she also has a lot of substance, emotional depth and a wealth of lived experiences,” her bio read. “Gabby is looking for a man with quiet confidence. She doesn’t have a physical type but says that if he doesn’t have a personality, then it’s a hard pass. Her ideal man will challenge her, communicate his feelings and work hard to equally carry the weight of the relationship.”</p><p>Her bio continued, “The one nonnegotiable for Gabby? Whatever man captures Gabby’s heart must also have room in their life for her four-legged friend because she and her goldendoodle Leonardo are a package deal. While Gabby would love to find a man, she isn’t the type to lose herself in a relationship. She’s hoping to find a man who will love her for the independent woman she is.”</p><p>For her fun facts, Gabby listed the following:</p><p>• Gabby is terrified of humpback whales but would love to see one in person from a safe distance.</p><p>• Gabby loves to write cards.</p><p>• Stomping grapes in Italy is at the top of Gabby’s bucket list.</p><p>Clayton also wasn’t Gabby’s first Bachelor Nation relationship. Gabby is the ex-girlfriend of both Dean Unglert from The Bachelorette season 13 with Rachel Lindsay and Blake Horstmann from The Bachelorette season 14 with Becca Kufrin. Dean, who also starred on Bachelor in Paradise season 5 and 6, confirmed the relationship on an episode of his “Help! I Suck at Dating” podcast in October 2021. “She was, like, one of the main exes. She was my girlfriend from college,” he said. “Producers called me and were like, ‘Hey, we’re thinking of casting this person — what do you think of her? We know that you dated 10 years ago.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, she’s great. If she gets selected for the show, she’ll either win the show or she’ll be the next Bachelorette.’ And I firmly believe that.”</p><p>Blake, who was also on Bachelor in Paradise season 6, also confirmed that he dated Gabby for a “couple months” on an episode of the “Behind the Rose” podcast in October 2021. “We like the same girls, man. I didn’t know Dean until obviously, like, 2018, but Gabby was a good friend of one of my very good friends from college, they were roommates,” he said. “I met Gabby long before I was on The Bachelorette, like, I want to say maybe 2015 or 2016. We hung out for a little bit, so I know her very well. And Dean, I don’t know how it came up, but one time, me and Dean were sitting there — I think we were in Buffalo, and he mentioned Gabby — and I was like, ‘How do you know Gabby?’ And he was like, ‘Dude, she was, like, my girl in college, you know, we were in love and blah blah.’”</p><p>He continued, “She’s fun. She has a very outgoing personality, very loud, like, when she walks into a room, you know she’s in a room. You never know if the lead is going to be into something like that. You never know if they like the more shy, quiet type or they like the loud, outgoing type, but she’s definitely very loud, very outgoing, she has a lot of friends. So if Clayton’s into that, I see her getting hometowns, for sure. She’s a beautiful woman. … They’re gonna have the football player, cheerleader story line.”</p><p>In an interview on the “Talking It Out With Bachelor Nation” podcast in January 2022, Gabby claimed that she and Blake “hung out for a little” but weren’t ever in an official relationship. “Blake and I had mutual friends,” Gabby said, noting that they met after she graduated from college in 2014.&nbsp;“We never actually went on a date. There was no drinks paid for. No dinner paid for. [Blake’s] saying we dated… He’s definitely friends of friends. You know, we had spent time together and stuff but definitely no, like, official dating, like, no really kind of formal, no exclusivity and again, it was a really long time ago.”</p><p>She called Dean, however, one of her “first loves.”&nbsp;“It was just so long ago,” she said. “It’s a distant past from my experience on ‘The Bachelor’ and you know, Clayton [Echard] and I’s story, it’s very much its own thing. I’m always really grateful that it was so far in the past, so I could focus more on Clayton and kind of separate [that].”</p><h2>Who is The Bachelorette 2022, Rachel Recchia?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Bachelorette-2022-Cast.jpg><p>Who is The Bachelorette 2022, Rachel Recchia?

Her Instagram handle is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@pilot.rachel</a>. She was eliminated in the final three after Clayton chose Susie Evans—whom he eliminated the episode before but invited back to the show—as his winner, sending home both Rachel and Gabby. During the “After the Final Rose” special, Gabby accused Clayton of never actually loving her because of the “disrespect” he showed her and Gabby and how he eliminated them with a “group breakup.” “It was almost as if you cast us aside as quickly as you could to [get to] the person you loved the most,” she said. Rachel also asked Clayton if he told her he loved her so he could sleep with her. “You told me that I was the first person that you said ‘I love you’ to in six years. I had no reason to ever doubt you,” she said. “So did you tell me that you were in love with me because you wanted to sleep with me?” Clayton denied this.</p><p>So who is The Bachelorette 2022, Rachel Recchia? Rachel listed her job on The Bachelor as a “Flight Instructor.” Her Instagram bio also lists her job as a pilot, as well as her Instagram handle @pilot.rachel. According to her Instagram, Rachel has flown in locations like Columbus, Ohio; Athens, Ohio; Springfield, Missouri; and Lakeland, Florida. She was also attended Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, where she was a cheerleader.</p><p>In her Bachelor bio, Rachel described herself as a “hopeless romantic” who is looking for someone “nurturing, empathetic” and “respectful.” “Rachel is a fearless frequent flyer looking for a man who will travel the world with her,” her bio reads. “After recently earning her private pilot license, the future is nothing but sunny skies ahead for Rachel and now she is hoping to find a co-pilot that matches her sense of adventure. As a hopeless romantic, Rachel is looking for someone who is as playful, passionate and spontaneous as she is. He should be nurturing, empathetic and MUST be respectful in all facets of life – to her, to family, and especially to waiters. In the end, Rachel wants to find crazy, insane love that makes sense to no one else but her and her soul mate.”</p><p>For her fun facts, Rachel listed the following:</p><p>• Rachel could live off of Flaming Hot Cheetos.</p><p>• Rachel can’t wait to read the Harry Potter series with her kids one day.</p><p>• Rachel once organized a flash mob in high school</p><h2>Who’s in The Bachelorette 2022 cast?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jesse-Palmer-The-Bachelor-1.jpg><p>Who is in The Bachelorette 2022 cast?

The Bachelorette season 19 host is Jesse Palmer, who was the season 5 Bachelor in 2004 and was the youngest Bachelor in Bachelor Nation history at 24 years old. Jesse hosted his first Bachelor franchise show in 2022 with The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard. During The Bachelor season 5 finale, Jesse gave his Final Rose to Jessica Bowlin, but didn’t propose to her. Jesse and Jessica continued to date, but ended their relationship a few weeks after the finale of their Bachelor season aired. In June 2020, Jesse and his girlfriend, Emely Fardo, married in an intimate wedding in New York City. Jesse told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in November 2021 that he and Emely planned to marry in Provence, France, before the current health crisis cancelled their wedding date. “We had originally planned a wedding in Provence, France, for summer 2020, which was postponed until summer of 2021 due to the pandemic, but we didn’t want to wait any longer,” he said at the time. “So, we had a small, private and intimate ceremony with close friends who lived in New York City.”</p><p>Jesse graduated from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played football for the Florida Gators, in 2001 with a bachelor’s of arts degree in political science and a bachelor’s of science degree in marketing. After graduation, Jesse was drafted by the National Football League to play for the New York Giants. He played with the team for four seasons from 2001 to 2005 as a quarterback. After the New York Giants, Jesse was drafted by the Canadian Football League to play for the Montreal Alouettes. He played with the team until 2005 when he was signed by the San Francisco 49ers. He then resigned with the Montreal Alouettes in 2006 before he retired from football in 2007 to pursue a broadcasting career. Since his broadcasting career started, Jesse has worked with networks like Fox, NFL Network, ESPN, ABC and SEC Network. He’s also guest starred on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and made guest appearances on shows like Recipe to Riches and Good Morning America, and hosted the Food Network’s Spring Baking Championship and Holiday Baking Championship.</p><p>Jesse was announced as The Bachelor season 26 host in September 2021. “For more than 20 years, The Bachelor has brought the world dozens of unforgettable love stories, including at one time, my own,” he said at the time. “Falling in love is one of life’s greatest gifts, and I am humbled by the opportunity to return to the show as host this season to offer the newest Bachelor advice gained from firsthand experience and I am grateful to play a small part in his journey.” The announcement came after Chris Harrison, the former host of Bachelor Nation, confirmed in June 2021 that he had retired as the franchise’s host after 19 years. “I’ve had a truly incredible run as host of The Bachelor franchise and now I’m excited to start a new chapter,” he wrote in an Instagram post at the time. “I’m so grateful to Bachelor Nation for all of the memories we’ve made together. While my two-decade journey is wrapping up, the friendships I’ve made will last a lifetime.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> reported at the time that Chris received a mid-range, eight-figure settlement as part of exit plan with ABC, the network that airs the Bachelor franchise, and Warner Bros. Television, the company that produces the Bachelor shows. The magazine also reported that Harrison’s settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. Chris’ decision to retire as Bachelor Nation’s host came after he was slammed for&nbsp;his response to season 25 Bachelor contestant <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael Kirkconnell’s racism</a> scandal in February 2021. <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael</a>, the <a href=# rel=noopener>winner of Matt James’ season</a>, faced backlash at the time when photos resurfaced of her at an Old South Antebellum-themed party at Georgia College in 2018. Before the pictures went viral, Rachael was already under controversy after her former high school classmate accused her on TikTok of bullying her and other students for dating Black men. Other TikTok users then exposed Rachael for liking social media photos of her friends in culturally insensitive costumes and with Confederate flags.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Chris came under controversy</a> after he was interviewed about the scandal by season 13 Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay on Extra. During the interview, Chris asked fans to give Rachael “grace” and explained that he didn’t find the Antebellum party photos offensive because they just looked like pictures a college student takes at a party. Harrison also questioned whether the photos would be considered racially insensitive in 2018 when they were taken. After the interview, many fans slammed Harrison and accused him of excusing Rachael’s behavior.</p><p>ABC confirmed in March 2021 that Chris wouldn’t host season 17 of The Bachelorette and would be replaced by Tayshia and Kaitlyn. “Chris Harrison will not be hosting the next season of The Bachelorette,” ABC said in a statement at the time. “We support Chris in the work that he is committed to doing. In his absence, former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe will support the new Bachelorette through next season. As we continue the dialogue around achieving greater equity and inclusion within The Bachelor franchise, we are dedicated to improving the BIPOC representation of our crew, including among the executive producer ranks. These are important steps in effecting fundamental change so that our franchise is a celebration of love that is reflective of our world.” He officially retired as the Bachelor Nation’s host in June 2021.</p><p>The Bachelorette airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC and is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.
