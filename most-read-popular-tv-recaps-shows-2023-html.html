As <a href=#>Andrew Ricketts at Okayplayer wrote</a>: “Snowfall makes the bold choice to portray how Black love survives or dies amid Black ruin.” There have been many instances of love surviving and dying throughout the show’s run and tonight’s finale, but because Franklin has always been at Snowfall’s center, it’s understandable to want to see his love survive. That desire is what makes Franklin’s ending so incredibly painful to watch. It’s natural for many viewers to want him to live happily ever after.

Okay, sometimes it isn’t all that delicate. But season seven opens with Jamie’s horrific and very detailed dream of Claire being hanged — they show a lot of this! Too much, some might say! — followed by his voiceover assuring himself that Claire is still alive, and he knows this because she is blood of his blood and bone of his bone, and he would feel it if she were gone from this world. Then he tells Ian, “Let’s go get my wife,” and the two ride off toward Wilmington as the new (good but a little creepy) version of the Outlander opening credits begins. Did I have to stop myself from standing up and cheering because I have some dignity but not that much? Why, yes, I did. I won’t apologize for the impulse — Jamie just loves Claire so, so much, and I am into it! I think we all are. Otherwise, why are we still here? The history lessons?

When the power suddenly goes out, a stark-naked Luke takes it as an opportunity to enter Margot’s cabin and climb into her bed while she’s unconscious. This prompts the producers to intervene, repeatedly telling Luke to get out of the bed and leave the room, but he refuses and tells them to “fuck off.” The episode concludes with the producers trying to force the door open as Aesha discovers the situation. The fact that Luke chose to enter Margot’s cabin while the lights were off shows exactly what his intentions were, and thank God the producers were there to stop him before things escalated. Luke is a predator, and him doing this on literal television makes you wonder what else he’s done in the past when cameras weren’t around. “ <a href=#><strong>Read the recaps</strong></a><strong> </strong>➼</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgub875002y3b818kvk3bac@published data-word-count=3><strong>The commenters say:</strong><strong></strong></p>elleapril August 8, 2023, 7:49 PM Aesha is an absolute 100% certified gem. <a href=# class=coral-nested-link>Rec 72</a> <span class=speech-bubble></span><a class=conversation-button href=#>Go to conversation</a><p class=slug data-editable=subsectionSlug></p><h2 class=title><span class=_20>20. </span><span class=_rupauls>RuPaul’s </span><span class=_drag>Drag </span><span class=_race>Race</span></h2><p class=byline data-editable=subsectionByline>By Jason P.

But unlike ol’ Car Bear, mother of a cat named Shoe (or Shoo, it remains unclear), I’m not talking about the expectations of what the future holds or accepting that you never really know what life has in store for you. No, the expectations I am letting go of are my expectations for this show. Once you let go of the idea of what you think And Just Like That … should be (the spiritual sequel to Sex and the City, coherent) and allow it to be what it is (chaos, about a woman unwilling to say “vaginal suppository”) it is a much more enjoyable experience. Let it wash over you! Let And Just Like That … live! It’s much more fun, I promise. Otherwise, I’d be over here raging about how the much-touted Last Supper at Carrie’s old apartment held so much potential for drama and mess and instead gave us an attempt at introspection and was kind of boring? And not even one gratuitous shot of great food. It gave so very little. But that doesn’t matter, because good-bye expectations … Hello, Samantha Jones.”&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Read the recaps</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>➼</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgvd41t007d3b81dafkguiz@published data-word-count=3><strong>The commenters say:</strong><strong></strong></p>copleyscott17 August 24, 2023, 5:19 PM Here's hoping Carrie runs into Aidan in Greece, cheating on her with Nia Vardalos.<br><a href=# class=coral-nested-link>Rec 125</a> <span class=speech-bubble></span><a class=conversation-button href=#>Go to conversation</a><p class=slug data-editable=subsectionSlug></p><h2 class=title><span class=_6>6. </span><span class=_the>The </span><span class=_marvelous>Marvelous </span><span class=_mrs>Mrs. </span><span class=_maisel>Maisel</span></h2><p class=byline data-editable=subsectionByline>By Sarene Leeds</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/56e/7b9/edcc3c239202ae695e8b16661813ae6e53-VPRules.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgvsia9007n3b81unjk65u0@published data-word-count=57><a href=#><strong>Season 5 Episode 9: You’re Fired</strong></a><strong>: </strong>“We open on the one detail the show has been avoiding for five seasons: Lenny Bruce’s downfall.

In a devastating scene near the end of the episode, Tom and Shiv reconvene in their penthouse for the first time since, presumably, agreeing to a trial separation in the wake of Tom’s stunning betrayal last season. Tom wants to talk. Shiv doesn’t. And that’s perhaps the fundamental difference between them: The Wambsgans-Roy partnership may seem like a wedding of convenience for a go-getting executive type like Tom, but of the two of them, he seems to have understood their relationship as a real marriage. “Do you want to talk?” he asks. “Because there are things I wouldn’t mind saying and explaining.” Shiv shares some of his sadness — they clasp hands wistfully at the end of the scene — but not the same desire and facility for real intimacy. Her father talks earlier in the episode about human interaction as “markets,” and she inherits his thinking.
