Tyler is undoubtedly talented, and he was selected in the first draft as the 21st overall in the 2013 NFL draft. We have a lot of juicy and motivational facts about him, and now you’ll learn everything.</p><h2><strong>Tyler Eifert Bio, Age</strong></h2><p>Tyler Gregory Eifert was born on September 8, 1990, in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He attended Saint Vincent De Paul Catholic School and Bishop Dwenger High School – all in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Most of the athletes are known for being active in high school sports. At Bishop Dwenger High School, Eifert played football and had 9 touchdowns on offense, 97 tackles, and 5 interceptions on defense. After graduating he was enrolled at the University of Notre Dame and played for the school’s team known as the Fighting Irish Football Team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tyler-Eifert.jpg><p>Eifert played in the 2010 season with 27 receptions for 352 yards and 2 touchdowns in 11 games. He was named a finalist for the 2011 Mackey Award for breaking his team’s record, which was previously held by Ken MacAfee as the record for the most individual receptions and reception places. After winning the Mackey Award in 2012, he decided to play in the professional league and gave up his senior year. During the 2013 NFL Draft, Eifert was selected 21st in the first round by the Cincinnati Bengals and signed a four-year contract worth $8.25 million.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is John Ross of the NFL? Here are 5 Facts You Need To Know</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Career and Injury History</strong></h2><p>Tyler Eifert has a long history of injuries that began for him as a younger athlete. He suffered a back injury in 2009 when he was a freshman in college, which meant that he only played one game all season. After joining the Cincinnati Bengals, he recorded five receptions for 47 yards in his very first game against the Chicago Bears. In his next game against the Pittsburg Steelers, he caught three passes for 66 yards and made a very long catch, considered his longest of the season. In December of the same year, he suffered a stinger injury and was unable to participate in the last game of the season.</p><p>In the 2014 season, Eifert again suffered a dislocated elbow caused by a tackle and stayed out of the game throughout the season to recover. In the 2015 season, he came back stronger and led his team to victory over the Oakland Raiders with nine 104-yard receptions and two touchdowns. After defeating the Baltimore Ravens and winning the 2016 Pro Bowl, a game presented and sponsored by the United Services Automobile Association, he played for Team Irvin in 2016 but injured his ankle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tyler-Eifert-Career.jpg><p>In the same year, he again suffered from back pain and underwent three surgeries, two for his persistent back pain, and the other for the removal of a cyst from his knee. The injuries he suffered severely affected his career. Instead of signing a long-term contract, he signed a one-year contract to stay with his team on March 15, 2018.</p><h2><strong>Net Worth & Salary</strong></h2><p>Tyler Eifert’s most recent one-year contract with the Bengalese is valued at $5.5 million and includes a signing bonus of $3 million and a $3 million guarantee. Given his talents and skills, his last contract should have been a mega-contract that would have placed him somewhere among the highest-paid tight ends in the league, but his injury problems have made his employers (as well as other recruiters) reluctant to sign him on a long-term contract. His current net assets are not available at this time.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Casey Lee Williams Bio – Facts You Need To Know About The Pop Singer</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Who is Tyler Eifert Dating? Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>The Tight End of Cincinnati Bengal is definitely not married yet, but not single either. Tyler Eifert is in a relationship and he has a girlfriend. The two caught the attention of the media in 2015. Her name is Rachael Kimack and she was born on July 31, 1991. Rachael received a degree in Health and Kinesiology from the University of Purdue in 2014. She was an athlete and played soccer on her school’s team, but was unable to continue due to injury. She currently works as a sales assistant at Medtronic Spine & Biologics.</p><p>However, there is speculation that the two are no longer together, as no one seems to see pictures of them on social media anymore. Whether they are still an object or not remains a mystery to all of us, except for their close friends and relatives. We will inform you about the state of affairs as soon as we receive clarifications.</p><h2><strong>Tyler Eifert Height and Weight</strong></h2><p>The greatness of the athlete is the envy of every young aspiring athlete. Tyler is one head and one shoulder taller than his colleagues in the league. His size must be one of the reasons why he plays so well. Eager can easily squeeze a smaller opponent who approaches him and throw him aside, which is one way of describing his commanding height advantage. He is 198 cm (6 feet) tall and weighs 116 kg (255 lbs).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwbq4xKtknqGWmr%2B1ecinoa6qqWK1qr%2FTqKmyZZGcsm60xKKeoaxdrLKqs8etZKedpGLEsL7ToWSsmZyWv7p5xqKppZ6inrKvsI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftyler-eifert-injury-history-age-height-weight-net-worth-salary-girlfriend.html&text=Tyler%20Eifert%20Injury%20History%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Girlfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftyler-eifert-injury-history-age-height-weight-net-worth-salary-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftyler-eifert-injury-history-age-height-weight-net-worth-salary-girlfriend.html&title=Tyler%20Eifert%20Injury%20History%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftyler-eifert-injury-history-age-height-weight-net-worth-salary-girlfriend.html&title=Tyler%20Eifert%20Injury%20History%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftyler-eifert-injury-history-age-height-weight-net-worth-salary-girlfriend.html&title=Tyler%20Eifert%20Injury%20History%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftyler-eifert-injury-history-age-height-weight-net-worth-salary-girlfriend.html&description=Tyler%20Eifert%20Injury%20History%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./celebrity-couples-who-could-break-up-in-2024-according-to-a-psychics-prediction.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrity couples who could break up in 2024 according to a psychic's prediction">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rare-barber-quarter-exact-date-under-neck.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rare Barber quarter sells for $35,250 - the exact date to look for under the neck">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
