Her narrative is one of a downward spiral, where circumstances and choices collide to shape a life overshadowed by the consequences of her actions. Susan's story is an example of how societal issues contribute to the cycle of crime and the challenges individuals like her face in breaking free from its grip.</p><h2>What is Susan Daniels Smith's story?</h2><p class=align-left>Susan died at the hands of her FBI handler in 1989, where she worked as an American FBI informant. She had helped the FBI and their agent, Mark Putnam, crack a <a href=#>robbery case</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec611b787f6d58a7.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who was Sydney Cassady?

Despite their ages of 22 and 15, the pair married and started a <a href=#>family</a>. By 1980, Susan had given birth to two children. However, the couple started having marital problems, mainly due to Kenneth's life of substance abuse. Susan and Kenneth eventually divorced but shared their home.</p><h3>What happened to Susan Daniels Smith?</h3><p class=align-left>In 1987, an FBI agent named Mark Putnam began an investigation in Pikeville, Kentucky. He was investigating 32-year-old ex-convict and bank robber Carl Edward "Cat Eyes" Lockhart. Lockhart was a friend of Susan's ex-husband, Kenneth Smith.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/903b7046b0203a7a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Sophia Rosing, the Kentucky 'Karen'?

After learning of Mark's return, Daniels contacted him about her pregnancy and told him the baby was his.

According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times</a>, on 12 June 1990, former FBI agent Mark Putnam confessed to killing Daniels. He led the police to her remains near an old coal-mining road north of Pikeville. In exchange, Mark was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser charge.</p><p class=align-left>In his <a href=#>written confession</a>, Mark said he strangled Daniels in a fit of rage because she was threatening to tell his wife and superiors that she was carrying his child.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e2c911f25838dfd5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is Martin Short gay?
