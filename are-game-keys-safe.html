Whether you're playing on a PC, console, or handheld device, most of us have played video games at some point in our lives. Today, you can buy video games in a number of ways, including through game keys. So, what are game keys, and are they safe to buy and use?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-are-game-keys>What Are Game Keys?</h2><p>While buying a video game used to involve going to a store and grabbing a hard copy, this is no longer required. Today, you can buy the virtual versions of video games via something known as game keys.</p><p>A game key is similar to a CD key, and are often referred to as such. Game keys are long strings of letters and numbers that look similar to voucher codes. And game keys aren't too dissimilar from online vouchers in the way that they work.</p><p>A game key, when bought, will act as a sort of gift card or voucher. What's different here is that game keys do not give you money; they instead give you the game itself in exchange for cash. Using the game key code, the game is "unlocked" on the given gaming store you're using, allowing you to access and play it. Once the code is entered on the supported platform, the title is ready to play.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On a game key site, you'll be able to search for the key you're looking for via the search bar or filtered categories. Once you find the one you want, you can grab it instantly if there are still some available. You'll usually receive an email containing the game key after you have paid. Most sites accept credit or debit card payments, with others also offering PayPal. Some sites even allow you to <a href=#>pay for game keys using cryptocurrency</a>.</p><p>What's different about game keys to your typical online games is the platform. Steam, for example, sells a wide range of video games, with some costing nothing, and others requiring big bucks. Game key sellers, on the other hand, can offer these games at a lower price. Game key sites can often sell these games at a lower price because they buy a large stock of a given game in bulk (similarly to how you can get products in bulk for a lower price at stores like Costco).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Game keys are now available on a wide range of gaming platforms, including Steam, Epic Games, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cd-keys-website.jpg><p>Because game keys have become so popular, there are now many websites that sell game keys, including CDKeys (as shown above), G2A, and Kinguin. <a href=#>CDKeys is one of the most widely used</a>, but there are many to choose from. Different sites offer keys at different prices on different gaming platforms.</p><p>People often head to game key sites to grab a bargain, but don't expect to grab every game key you want for a super low price simply because they're just keys. After all, in the end, you're still getting the same product, regardless of how you accessed it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn't to say that game keys aren't discounted. You can sometimes get some real steals on these sites. But don't always expect a huge price drop, especially for newer and more popular games.</p><p>The rising popularity of game keys has also attracted malicious actors who want to capitalize on this growing part of the gaming industry, putting many at risk of being scammed. This is where game keys can become dangerous. But are all game keys unsafe?</p><h2 id=are-game-keys-safe>Are Game Keys Safe?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fog-computer-1.jpg><p>You've got good guys and bad guys in the game key market. Many sites are completely harmless, and offer an easy way to access the video games you love. But there is a darker side here that you should be aware of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because game keys are entirely virtual, it's not difficult for cybercriminals to exploit unsuspecting customers with fake or non-existent keys. By developing a convincing website, using the right language, and offering sought-after products, a scammer can trick a victim into paying real money for something they will never get.</p><p>Game key scams are by no means uncommon, and can happen on even the most popular platforms. Some game key sites are also public marketplaces, allowing individuals to resell their own game keys. In this case, scams can be even more likely, as public marketplaces make it that much easier for a malicious seller to hop on the platform and trick buyers. In such a scenario, you may buy a game key from a seller, and even have a key sent to your email address. But, when you enter the key on your chosen gaming platform, you are told that the key has already been used, or doesn't exist at all. At this point, the scammer already has your money in their pocket.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Game key scammers won't always just be after a one-off payment either. <a href=#>Some malicious sites</a> are designed to steal all inputted data, including contact details and payment information. If you come across such a site when shopping for game keys, you may end up handing highly sensitive data to a cybercriminal without even realizing it.</p><p>What's more, some scammers will also ask game developers for "review keys". Here, scammers will try to access a new game for free under the guise of wanting to give it a review. However, in reality, the scammer will likely take the game key and resell it elsewhere for a profit.</p><h2 id=how-to-find-safe-game-keys>How to Find Safe Game Keys</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hand-keyboard-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're interested in buying game keys, but you're not sure where to do so safely, we've got some tips on how to find legitimate sites, as well as how to spot suspicious ones.</p><h3 id=how-to-safely-buy-game-keys>How to Safely Buy Game Keys</h3><p>The first step to safely buying game keys is to ensure that you are using a well-reviewed site. When it comes to using online retailers, other customers' reviews can be very telling, and can indicate whether a site is to be trusted. So, if you come across a game key site that you're interested in, do a little search for reviews outside the website itself to get a real, non-biased idea of what you're dealing with.</p><p>Secondly, you should avoid using your raw payment card details if possible, especially when the site in question isn't massively well known. Payment vendors like PayPal exist to safely facilitate online payments, so it's wise to use such services when you're dealing with a site you haven't bought from before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also wise to check the "About Us" or "FAQ" section of your chosen game key seller to see how the process is supposed to work. Most game key sites email you the key very soon after payment, but others may have stipulations to be aware of, such as a delay in the key reception time. Having a look at the transaction process will help you in understanding what you're paying for, as well as how and when you'll be getting it.</p><h3 id=signs-of-a-suspicious-game-key-site>Signs of a Suspicious Game Key Site</h3><p>A key indicator of a suspicious game key site is very, very low prices. Say, for example, a new game has just been released, and is retailing for $60. If you head to a game key site and see a key for this game being sold for $10 or $20, be on your guard. Scam sites often offer products at a huge discount to lure in buyers looking for a deal, so consider how realistic the price of a game key is if you've noticed it's selling for cheap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of this, you should always <a href=#>take note of negative reviews</a>. If you've noticed a particular game key site has a lot of unhappy customers, chances are you may end up one, too. It's always safer to avoiding risking it when it comes to these dubious vendors, no matter how tempting a product may seem.</p><h2 id=game-keys-certainly-come-with-risks>Game Keys Certainly Come With Risks</h2><p>Game keys allow you to quickly find and access online games, often at a discounted price. This is certainly a win, but it's wise to acknowledge the risks involved here. If you're looking to buy game keys, note the dangers discussed above, and keep our tips in mind for buying keys safely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiYq51dnK6usYyknLKrXaiup7GO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-game-keys-safe.html&text=Are%20Game%20Keys%20Safe%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-game-keys-safe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-game-keys-safe.html&title=Are%20Game%20Keys%20Safe%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-game-keys-safe.html&title=Are%20Game%20Keys%20Safe%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-game-keys-safe.html&title=Are%20Game%20Keys%20Safe%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-game-keys-safe.html&description=Are%20Game%20Keys%20Safe%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./c-sar-vora.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Csar vora">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alan-walkers-net-worth-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alan Walker's Net Worth (2023)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
