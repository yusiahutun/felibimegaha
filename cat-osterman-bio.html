Eventually, for the high school softball team, Osterman recorded several milestones.</p><p>Moving on, the Houston native created a sensation after she struck out 33 batters in a 1-0 shutout within <i>14 innings</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/180330347_318893586266382_8549212064786530382_n-819x1024.jpg><p>The game was against Cy-Fair High School, a rival high school team.</p><p>Moreover, this breathtaking performance was cited as a national record for most strikeouts in a single game under <i>20 innings</i>, displacing Jenny Stallard to occupy first place.</p><p>With a successful junior-level career after graduating high school, Cat targeted joining the University of Texas.</p><p>Upon breaking out in her freshman, Osterman got named the Second Team All-American by the National Fastpitch Coaches Association.</p><h2>Cat Osterman | Age, Height, & Body Measurements</h2><p>Born in 1983, Cat Osterman is 40 years old.</p><p>Besides, she stands at an astounding height of<strong> 6’3″</strong> (<strong>1.90</strong> <strong>m</strong>), becoming one of the tallest female athletes in sporting history.</p><p>However, we are not trying to misinform you, as we know there are much taller players than the Houston native.</p><p>Osterman was a sturdy woman during her playing career, strong, agile, and acutely well-versed on and off the pitch.</p><p>Although we do not have accurate Cat measurements, it comes to one’s assumption that the former softball pitcher has an ectomorphic build.</p><p>Further, even after retirement, Osterman believes that you are always an athlete once you are an athlete.</p><p>Hence, the Texan doesn’t miss a day of training. Regardless of the occasion, she prioritizes her workouts and proper diet.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, the retired softball star weighs <strong>79kg</strong> (<strong>174</strong> <strong>lb</strong>), which is valid considering her towering stature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/242377872_409698353852571_8493318250644364552_n-1024x683.jpg><p>Most importantly, Cat’s distinguishing feature is her tall body frame, generally straightened dark blonde hair, ovular face, and a smile that stretches wide to compliment her beauty.</p><p>However, in some instances, Osterman ties her long hair into a ponytail.</p><p>On the other hand, the Houston native is ambidextrous, but her preferred hand is left for both batting and throwing.</p><p>On top of that, Catherine recorded a 70-mile-per-hour pitch speed from her left hand when most right-handed players struggled to reach that mark.</p><h2>Cat Osterman | Career: Softball & Coach | When Did Cat Osterman Retire?</h2><p>Osterman might be one of the greatest athletes in the world, if not the best.</p><p>Additionally, when the Houston native enrolled at the <strong>University of Texas</strong>, she became a sensation, bagging <strong>Pitcher of The Year</strong> and receiving a mention in the Big 12&nbsp;First Team.</p><p>On the contrary, Cat was equally invaluable as the Texan contributed 15 wins with a 28-appearance undefeated streak.</p><p>Simultaneously, Cat struck out 247 batters for Team U.S.A., giving up 37&nbsp;hits and 18 walks in 116.2 innings in her international career.</p><h3>Junior Hero | 2002</h3><p>Further, Cat shamed every record the previous U.T. players held in a single season.</p><p>For instance, Osterman led in the category for the highest number of wins as a starter, strikeouts, appearances, innings pitched, shutouts, and strikeout ratio.</p><p>Likewise, the fastest pitcher debuted on February 6 for her University in a two-hit, 11 fannings, and six-shutout inning of the Texas A&M–Corpus Christi Islanders.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cat-Osterman-.jpg><p>Subsequently, Cat recorded 24 strikeouts in 10 innings and marked 34 strikeouts, landing a Top 5 spot at the NCAA, tying with <strong>Nicole Neuerburg.</strong></p><p>In like manner, the Houston native became the first-ever freshman from U.T. to win the Pitcher of The Week at the Big 12 Conference.</p><p>Eventually, with a win over Texas Bobcats, Osterman completed a perfect game against Stephen&nbsp;F. Austin State Lumberjacks.</p><p>It was a magnificent feat achieved by a U.T. Freshman, being the only one to do so.</p><h3>Best Sophomore | 2003</h3><p>Similarly, Cat blazed past the sophomore year with spectacular achievements.</p><p>The Texan repeated her award collection season by taking home an All-American nomination, Big 12 Pitcher, and Female Athlete of The Year recognitions.</p><p>Contrarily, the number of successes didn’t faze Osterman as she kept her form alive by throwing four no-hitters, managing a perfect game, and breaking self-made records.</p><p>To illustrate, with a leading NCAA shutout and strikeout ratio, Cat’s pitching streak continued with 65 scoreless innings, ultimately broken against U.L.L. Ragin’ Cajuns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cat-956.jpg><p>Simultaneously, the softball star needed only <i>500 innings</i> to book a spot in a club, being the fewest to acquire by a pitcher in NCAA Division I.</p><p>Additionally, Cat went on to get named as an All-Tournament Team after shutting out <strong>California Golden Bears</strong> on a doubleheader game day.</p><h3>The hope of Olympics | Athens</h3><p>Alongside her fellow U.T. teammate <a href=#><strong>Jennie</strong> <strong>Finch</strong></a>, Osterman competed in the Olympic Games held in Athens.</p><p>Her first-ever experiences with the U.S.A.

With the two wins, the Texan booked a place in the Olympiad.</p><p>Again, on August 14, with a 7-0 victory over Italy, Team U.S.A. beat Japan 3-0 and Chinese Taipei by 3-0.</p><p>Also, the Cat recorded two missed hit, striking out 23 batters&nbsp;under <i>14 innings</i>, which helped <strong>Team U.S.A. </strong>further the lead.</p><h3>College Year | 2005-2006</h3><p>Cat accepted the Honda Sports Award with a 2005 Sportswoman of the Year to commence another successful season.</p><p>The no-hitter queen doesn’t rest, does she?</p><p>Further, Osterman broke previously set records for the number of strikeouts, strikeout ratio, opponents’ batting average, shutouts, and completed games.</p><p>Also, with 20 batters struck out under seven innings and a 5-1 win over UTSA Roadrunners, the game became second-best in NCAA’s history and Osterman’s best-ever in her entire career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cat-955.jpg><p>Similarly, on February 15, the Texan struck six batters in a 7-2 win against Fresno State Bulldog.</p><p>In like manner, UNLV Rebels faced a bitter defeat of 4-0 after seven batters struck out. At that moment, Cat surpassed <strong>Courtney Blades’</strong> milestone by totaling 1744.</p><p>Despite an excellent performance, the Texan lost a match for the first time that season against Michigan Wolverines.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Olympic pitcher registered 1900 strikeouts, a first in NCAA Division&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;history.</p><p>Finally, Catherine became the eighth softball player to win 120 games on March 29, 2006, tying with <strong>Britni Sneed</strong>.</p><p>Furthermore, another career milestone came Osterman’s way after landing 6th place with her <strong>124</strong>th and <strong>125</strong>th win consecutively.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>To begin with, her professional career started with a first overall pick softball league draft of National Pro Fastpitch.</p><p>After refusing to sign for the Connecticut Brakettes, Cat chose Rockford Thunder on December 19, 2006.</p><p>Again, her professional career had its ups and downs, but the Texan would forever be regarded as a soft balling legend.</p><p>On August 26, 2007, Cat made 126 strikeouts in her rookie season and helped the team qualify for Cowles Cup Championship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cat-962.jpg><p>Even though the Houston native registered an all-time career-best E.R.A. and WHIP&nbsp;and a 55-inning shutout streak, a loss to USSSA Pride dissolved the achievement.</p><p>Regardless, Cat assisted the Thunders in lifting the Cowles Cup Championship after defeating Akron Racers in August of 2009.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Belen Mozo Bio: Age, Career, Injury, Net Worth, Fiance, Retirement Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Well, every good story ends as Osterman declares her retirement, propelling her to have the best career season.</p><p>Additionally, in August 2013, Cat lifted the <strong>Cowles Cup</strong> and took home an <strong>M.V.P</strong>.</p><p>Besides, the Texan wore the crown of Pitcher of The Year, topped off with an 18-game winning streak, making it an overall perfect season.</p><p>Meanwhile, with yet another Cowles Cup win, Osterman completed a streak of 149 innings, 63 hits, 11 runs, and 40 walks&nbsp;and drove away 273&nbsp;hitters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cat-958-1.jpg><p>After joining the Pride in the 2011/12 season, Cat’s contribution led to several achievements for the Floridians.</p><p>Therefore, the management announced on June 8, 2017, to retire the No. 8 jerseys&nbsp;by a collective decision.</p><p>Further, the Houston native ranks first in strikeout ratio and no-hitters with a close second place in E.R.A. and overall strikeouts.</p><p>On top of that, she is the only softball pitcher to reach 1000 career strikeouts.</p><h3>International Career</h3><p>For instance, her career began with a no-hitter at the Canada Cup of 2003.
