During Monday’s segment, Harry shed more light on his relationship with <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#>his hopes for possible reconciliation</a>.</p><p>“There has always been this competition between us, weirdly,” Harry said of his older brother, 40. “Again, I think it really plays into — or is played by — the heir/spare [mentality].”</p><p>When asked whether he thought William was ever <a href=#>jealous of his position</a> further down in the line of succession, Harry said yes. “But I have more freedom than he does, right?” he continued, adding that he never wanted to simply live “in the monarch’s shadow” before leaving his senior royal role. “<a href=#>His life is planned out for him</a>. I have more flexibility to be able to choose the life that I wanted.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Prince-Harry-Implies-William-Was-Jealous.jpg><p>The prince reflected on often being pitted “against” William and <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate</strong></a> within the British press, but he acknowledged that <a href=#>he “without question” is partially responsible</a> for the “wedge” that’s been placed between him and the future king.</p><p>“What people don’t know is <a href=#>the efforts that I’ve gone to</a> [in order] to resolve this privately, both with my brother and with my father,” Harry said on Monday. “I hope that [William and I] will be joined at the hip again. Because, you know, if there’s something that will terrify the British press more than anything, it’s William and I being aligned.”</p><p>In a teaser for the interview released Friday, January 6, Harry reflected on how his late mother, <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>, would react to <a href=#>his estrangement from his family</a> — and brother William in particular. “I think she would be sad,” the former military pilot confessed. “I think she’d be looking at it long-term to know that there are certain things that we need to go through to be able to heal the relationship.”</p><p>Harry added that <a href=#>he’s felt the “presence” of the late Princess of Wales</a>, who died in August 1997 when he was 12 years old, “more so in the last two years than I have in the last 30.”</p><p>The duke’s distance from his brother and dad <a href=#><strong>King Charles III</strong></a> was exacerbated by his January 2020 announcement that he and <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a> were <a href=#>stepping down from their senior royal duties</a>. The couple, who wed in May 2018, <a href=#>subsequently moved to California</a>. Buckingham Palace confirmed in February 2021 that the twosome, who share son Archie, 3, and daughter Lilibet, 19 months, would not return as senior working royals.</p><p>Since stepping away from the royal spotlight, both Harry and Meghan, 41, have been candid about their highs and lows within The Firm. In Spare, the BetterUp CIO further detailed <a href=#>his most trying personal challenges</a> — and <a href=#>his biggest conflicts</a> with his relatives.</p><p>“Two years older than me, Willy was the Heir, whereas I was the Spare. This wasn’t merely how the press referred to us — though it was definitely that. This was shorthand often used by Pa and Mummy and Grandpa. And even Granny,” Harry wrote, referring to late grandparents <a href=#>Prince Philip</a> and <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, respectively, who emphasized <a href=#>his place in the line of succession</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Prince-Harry-Implies-William-Was-Jealous-2.jpg><p>Being Charles and Diana’s second child <a href=#>made Harry feel like the “plan B”</a> of the family. “I was summoned to provide backup, distraction, diversion and, if necessary, a spare part. Kidney, perhaps. Blood transfusion. Speck of bone marrow,” he continued. “This was all made explicitly clear to me from the start of life’s journey and regularly reinforced after.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When it comes to <a href=#>potentially repairing his relationships</a> with his father and brother, Harry is hopeful they can mend fences — but claimed in his ITV interview that Charles and William have “shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile.”</p><p>“There’s a lot that can happen between now and [my father’s coronation],” he said on Sunday of the May event. “But, you know, the door is always open. The ball is in their court. There’s a lot to be discussed and I really hope that they are willing to sit down and talk about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5x5qpq7Fdmba0r9Ssqp6rXay2rbjImqRmqpmbwW6%2BzrKYpWWWlrqquNhmpqdll6KucA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprince-harry-discusses-william-rift-royal-family-on-gma.html&text=Prince%20Harry%20Discusses%20William%20Rift%2c%20Royal%20Family%20on%20%27GMA%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-harry-discusses-william-rift-royal-family-on-gma.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-discusses-william-rift-royal-family-on-gma.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20Discusses%20William%20Rift%2c%20Royal%20Family%20on%20%27GMA%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprince-harry-discusses-william-rift-royal-family-on-gma.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20Discusses%20William%20Rift%2c%20Royal%20Family%20on%20%27GMA%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-discusses-william-rift-royal-family-on-gma.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20Discusses%20William%20Rift%2c%20Royal%20Family%20on%20%27GMA%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-harry-discusses-william-rift-royal-family-on-gma.html&description=Prince%20Harry%20Discusses%20William%20Rift%2c%20Royal%20Family%20on%20%27GMA%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-middleton-prince-william-attend-buckingham-palace-garden-party.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Prince and Princess of Wales surprise guests at palace garden party - best photos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./italian-princess-war-sister-100m-inheritance-film-star-mother-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Italian princess at war with sister over 100m inheritance from film star mother">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
