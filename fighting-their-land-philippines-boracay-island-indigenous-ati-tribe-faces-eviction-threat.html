And someday, sell it. At least your children and grandchildren will be millionaires”. He also directed the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to train the beneficiaries to properly utilise the land.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/f18e7456-522d-4de9-8c01-0f0163338534_a18f5966.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But six of Boracay’s hotel owners, who are among the richest land developers in the Philippines, do not want that to happen. They have filed claims to the Ati’s CLOA land in court on the basis that it is private land and, ironically, DAR seems to be on the developers’ side.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have exhaustively discussed the pertinent rules, issuances, memorandum and jurisprudence to support the right of the Ati as land reform beneficiaries as identified by the president of the republic. What DAR has done on these cases is all wrong,” Daniel Dinopol, a local lawyer representing the Ati community, told This Week in Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Big businesspeople close to Malacanang [the presidential palace] want to claim the land so they can build resorts or a hotel in the area, because the cost of land per square metre at present is between 120 million and 200 million pesos (US$2.2 million-US$3.5 million).”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/1b8cefd2-d8af-4f45-a512-8be025008a3c_a66cec46.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The battle between the rich land developers and the impoverished Ati people goes back to 2011, when the government issued a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title to 2.1 hectares of beachfront property on the island. The Ati people have established a community for themselves here with permanent housing, a church, a school and a tribal museum. There are 265 people, comprising 55 families, living on this land.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title is not being challenged, the CLOA land allocations have only served to increase tensions between the Ati and developers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On February 22, 2013, on his way home from a meeting, young Ati leader and spokesman Dexter Condez was shot dead. Condez was among the most vocal in the Ati’s fight for their ancestral land. The main suspect, who was not punished, was a security guard at one of the claimants’ hotels.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The community remains undeterred by Condez’s murder and has taken the fight with the powerful business families to the courts, with Dinopol representing them on a pro bono basis. They must also fight two government agencies that are supposed to help communities like theirs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/79a276eb-0d8b-4d72-b0de-c6441eb8fec7_a66cec46.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In four resolutions issued since March last year, DAR has supported the protest petitions of property developers over the 3.2 hectares of land granted under CLOA. DAR directed the developers to file for cancellation of the CLOAs, which, if approved, would allow the developers to acquire the land for tourism purposes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DAR based its resolution on a certification from the Bureau of Soils and Water Management submitted by the petitioners concluding that the CLOA areas were “no longer viable for agricultural production”, supposedly based on soil tests done on Ati land.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bureau said the lands were instead “highly recommended for Eco-Tourism Zones and or Medium Density Tourist Commercial Zones”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dinopol said they questioned the certificate because the bureau’s mandate was to work with DAR to determine the soil composition so that they could advise the farmer-beneficiaries the types of crops suited for the land.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/821aaeda-7667-4614-b4d5-ed65f0cc096e_a66cec46.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On March 27, DAR dealt a blow to the Ati community by issuing a press release saying it had cancelled all four CLOA titles, based on soil tests that the land was not suitable for agriculture. DAR added that the displaced Ati villagers would be allocated alternative government land for farming.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dinopol said the villagers had not been given any details on where the new land was supposed to be. “If the DAR has the power to allocate lands to the Ati, why cancel the CLOA and give another piece of land somewhere in lieu of the one already being used? This is ridiculous logic,” he said, adding the Ati had no intention of leaving their land.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Boracay Ati Tribal Organisation says it has reached out to the Philippines’ Commission on Human Rights, asserting that the impending eviction violates the Ati’s human rights.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">House Deputy Minority leader France Castro has also called for a congressional investigation into the issue, saying the “developers [are] being favoured by DAR instead of the indigenous people who naturally grew up in the area”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/3d16aac5-557f-482f-88c0-3755132be5a9_a18f5966.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For now, the Ati are continuing with daily life and going about their business.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This Week in Asia recently visited one of the land parcels allocated to the Ati where a dragon fruit farm – owned by community farming cluster leader Leonida Bartolome – with more than 400 plants is thriving. There are also banana, lemongrass, papaya and vegetable plots, as well as a small chicken farm. Seven families live there, and dragon fruits harvested every six months are sold to hotels and farm visitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bartolome stressed the land’s importance to the Ati. “It is very important for the families here to have land to live [as a community, as] we were like nomads before,” she said, as she proudly showed off the farm that she said brought in good income.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“DAR did not come to the land to do a survey before making judgment this land is not suitable for farming,” Sister Elvie Oliamot, a Catholic nun serving the Ati community, told This Week in Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are fighting because DAR [said] the land is not suitable for agriculture. We have worked hard to develop this as agricultural land. But now they want to take it back.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/3b263d2f-17b9-4e50-940a-33c9440efb3b_a18f5966.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ati tribal leader Delsa Justo told This Week in Asia that in 2019, before the pandemic, the community leaders met DAR several times, but only received in return a used transport vehicle, solar panels that never worked, and a greenhouse that was unusable.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“DAR wanted to lend us 7 million pesos to start farming the land as capital – but we didn’t agree to take a loan,” Justo said. “The property was like a dumping site and DAR helped to get the baranguay [local council] to come and clean it. After cleaning, they set about taking back the property.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Community leaders say that instead of fighting to take their land, they hope authorities can better integrate the indigenous Ati culture into the local tourism industry. For example, the annual Ati-Atihan festival in January – showcasing the Ati tribe’s traditional dresses, drumming and dancing – regularly attracts tourists to Boracay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This could help more people understand local culture and traditions, and correct the misconception that the Ati people were poor and uneducated, Justo said, adding that they were also bullied because of their skin colour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many among the Ati community have in fact received education and are now working in professions such as teachers, police officers and social workers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sister Elvie said it was greed that was driving the conflict in Boracay. “We pray to God, that DAR will not go with the money.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGprbWdufnN7xaKeoayZo7RuwMeeoKtlnJa7pXnPoaCloaCltq%2Bx0maZqKqRmK66eciso5qmlGK2r7DIoJynp6WoeqLAyGarq6GSmnqnrcKeqmadpp6wtbXOp2StoKKarrU%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffighting-their-land-philippines-boracay-island-indigenous-ati-tribe-faces-eviction-threat.html&text=Fighting%20for%20their%20land%3a%20on%20Philippines%20Boracay%20island%2c%20indigenous%20Ati%20tribe%20faces%20eviction%20threa&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffighting-their-land-philippines-boracay-island-indigenous-ati-tribe-faces-eviction-threat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffighting-their-land-philippines-boracay-island-indigenous-ati-tribe-faces-eviction-threat.html&title=Fighting%20for%20their%20land%3a%20on%20Philippines%20Boracay%20island%2c%20indigenous%20Ati%20tribe%20faces%20eviction%20threa" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffighting-their-land-philippines-boracay-island-indigenous-ati-tribe-faces-eviction-threat.html&title=Fighting%20for%20their%20land%3a%20on%20Philippines%20Boracay%20island%2c%20indigenous%20Ati%20tribe%20faces%20eviction%20threa" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffighting-their-land-philippines-boracay-island-indigenous-ati-tribe-faces-eviction-threat.html&title=Fighting%20for%20their%20land%3a%20on%20Philippines%20Boracay%20island%2c%20indigenous%20Ati%20tribe%20faces%20eviction%20threa" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffighting-their-land-philippines-boracay-island-indigenous-ati-tribe-faces-eviction-threat.html&description=Fighting%20for%20their%20land%3a%20on%20Philippines%20Boracay%20island%2c%20indigenous%20Ati%20tribe%20faces%20eviction%20threa" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./660ea3cdca4741f63a8b45aa-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LaLiga EA Sports 2024: Joao Flix: &amp;quot;Bernardo Silva me ha preguntado por el Bara&amp;quot;">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./big-brothers-big-sisters-plant-sale-back-in-bloom.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Big Brothers Big Sisters plant sale back in bloom">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
