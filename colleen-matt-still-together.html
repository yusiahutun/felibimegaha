During their 10 days in “The Pods”, the couples decide if they wanted to get engaged—still sight unseen—or end their relationships for a better connection with someone else. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on a honeymoon, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or breakup as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Since <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> premiered on Netlix in 2020, the show has become one of service’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> about how&nbsp;the connections on <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> were based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>But back to Colleen and Matt. So…are <a href=# rel=noopener>Colleen and Matt still together from Love Is Blind season 3</a>? Read on for what we know about if Colleen and Matt are still together after Love Is Blind season 3 and where they are now since the “After the Altar” special finished filming.</p><h2>Are Colleen and Matt still together from Love Is Blind season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Colleen-Matt-Love-Is-Blind-Season-3.png><p>Are <a href=# rel=noopener>Colleen and Matt still together</a> after Love Is Blind season 3? The answer is yes. Colleen and Matt confirmed they were still together in the Love Is Blind season 3 “After the Altar” special in February 2023. She also confirmed they were still together when the special aired by posting a photo of them on her Instagram Story with the caption, “If there’s one thing you need to know about The Boltons, it’s that we’re going to SHOW UP.” Colleen and Matt were one of two couples who said “I do” at the altar of their wedding day in episode 11 of Love Is Blind season 3. The other couple was Alexa Alfia and Brennon Lemieux.</p><p>Colleen and Matt married on July 2, 2021, according to the marriage license filed in the County of Dallas, Texas. The license listed Colleen Bridget Reed as applicant one, and Matthew Ray Bolton as applicant two. The license was recorded on July 16, 2021, and seemed to confirm Colleen and Matt married in the Love Is Blind season 3 finale three days after Alexa and Brennon, who married on June 30, 2021. TikTok user @<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">broopitt</a> also confirmed Colleen and Matt were still together in November 2022 when they posted two videos of them shopping at Target. “Think it’s safe to say Colleen and Matt got married,” the user wrote over the video. “You allowed me to break out of my shell. You allowed me to become vulnerable again. I was in a bad way before all of this, from a relationship standpoint.The comfort level you gave me and just allowing me to become vulnerable again, it speaks volumes. I love you to death. Absolutely, I do. I want to marry you,” Matt told Colleen at the altar of their wedding.</p><p>Colleen and Matt confirmed they were still together and married in the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion. They also revealed at the time that they weren’t living together, but planned to move in together a few months after the reunion filmed. “Logistics-wise and money-wise, we weren’t there. As soon as the wedding, the next day, we weren’t money-wise ready to give up on our leases,” Colleen said. “It’s a very complicated situation. We got married in an unorthodox way, so we’re doing marriage in an unorthodox way.” She continued, “We have a plan in a couple months. We made sure our leases line up in the same amount of time, and we are going to move in together. I can’t wait to move in with him, and I’m going to spend the rest of my life with him. So I’m content. We are content. We are on the same page with how we’re doing things.”</p><p>Colleen and Matt also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time about what their relationship has been like since they married in July 2021. “You learn a lot. Getting out of the show and the whole atmosphere, you learn a lot about each other,” Matt said. “It kind of started off rough right when we got out of it… in the sense of knowing that you just got married. So now you’ve got to take your schedule and incorporate her scheduling. You’ve got to blend them together.” He continued, “And if you have certain things you like to do on the weekends, sometimes you can’t do them anymore. So just learning how to kind of mesh like that was tough at the very beginning… it’s just learning how to incorporate each other into your daily lives. But at this point, we’re as good as we’ve ever been.”</p><p>Before the Love Is Blind season 3 finale aired, fans speculated over Colleen and Matt’s relationship status based on their social media behavior. Colleen and Matt didn’t follow each other on Instagram and hadn’t liked any of each other’s posts. However, they were friends on Venmo, though Matt’s Venmo transactions are private. Colleen, however, was still friends with many contestants from Love Is Blind season 3, including Raven Ross and Alexa Alfia. She had several transactions between the women around the time they took a girls’ trip to Scottsdale, Arizona, for a girl’s trip that seemed to be Alexa’s second Bachelorette party.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Women’s Health</a> after Love Is Blind season 3, Colleen apologized for a conversation she had with another contestant, Cole Barnett, about how Colleen was more his type than his fiance, Zanab Jaffrey. “Cole definitely crossed a line in opening that up,” she said. “I don’t think it would have ever been discussed if he wouldn’t have kind of started that conversation.” She continued, “I see now how being too nice can be inappropriate, and I’ve apologized immensely to Zanab and to Matt, and we’ve all kind of moved well past it. And I’ve grown a lot from that. And I apologize to this day that it was at Zanab and Matt’s expense.” Matt also told the magazine about how he felt Cole was out of line for the comment but Colleen’s decision to tell him about it made his “trust factor” in her increase. In the interview, Matt also apologized for how he reacted after Colleen revealed that she told Cole “he was a cut guy.” “I kind of wish I could go back a little bit and not have run away so quickly, right after something like that it happened, because she did come to me and explain it all,” Matt said. “I don’t think I handled it the best. I think it was just fine to be upset at the comment. But like I said, I wish I could have handled a little better.”</p><p>Colleen also explained to People how she and Matt recovered after her conversation with Cole. “With me and Matt, there was never any trust issues. With the whole Cole situation, there was more that was said in terms of me saying, ‘There’s a reason why me and Cole didn’t work out, there’s a reason why me and Matt are together, and there’s a reason why Cole and Zanab were together,'” she said. She continued, “I tried to explain that to Matt, but that was one of my challenges is communicating in conflict and it got messed up and then it turned into a game of telephone. So it was more about how we deal with conflict and how I gain a backbone and shut things down then be too nice than trust for us.”</p><p>She also added that, while she wouldn’t change anything about her relationship with Matt, she wished she would’ve handled her conversation with Cole in a different way.&nbsp;“Everything happens for a reason and me and Matt found each other, so I don’t wish that I did anything differently with Matt,” she said. “We were very transparent with each other and I’m proud of us for being so open and honest.” She continued, “The only thing would be definitely shutting down that conversation with Cole in the pool because I love [Zanab] so much. So yeah, I wish I would do that conversation differently.”</p><p>Matt also explained to People in November 2022 why he told Colleen “I do” on their wedding day. “Obviously there were a lot of conversations that you guys didn’t see,” he said. “Going through those, I’m glad that we did go through those little stir-ups though because it allowed us to learn how we handle certain things.” He continued, “If I could take anything back, it would be not run away from that stuff. That was something that we kind of came to — ‘Don’t run away when something happens’ — and I felt like I was kind of looking for an out.</p><p>Matt also responded to viewers who questioned why he and Colleen married given the up and down nature of their relationship in the lead up to their wedding. <span>“Leading up to it, even after the aquarium scene, we had a lot of conversations that you guys didn’t see, about if we really wanted to do this, and we knew we loved each other. We saw so much potential, and it was just on the day of, we still didn’t know,” he said. “But when I saw her walking down the aisle, I was like, ‘Listen, we’ve got too much potential. This is such a great moment. We are meant for each other.’ So we just had to do it. Can’t pass it up.” Colleen also told People that she and Matt were “so in love” but “we were having conflicts and that’s what I was questioning, ‘Is love enough?'” She continued, “You see me toy with that question throughout the season, and same thing with him. We knew that we had these immense feelings for each other, but marriage is a very serious thing and we’re not taking this lightly… we were just going with how we felt and with our gut feeling. And at the end of the day, yes, love is enough for me and Matt. And as soon as I saw him crying and snorting down the aisle, I knew that that was my person.”</span></p><h2>Who is Colleen from Love Is Blind season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Colleen_Reed_Love-Is-Blind-Season-3.jpg><p>Who is Colleen from Love Is Blind season 3?

Love Is Blind season 1 was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia, while season 2 was filmed in Chicago, Illinois. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020, Love Is Blind creator Chris Coelen explained that each season casts contestants from the same city so long distance isn’t a factor in their relationships. “It was a really interesting and diverse cast in terms of the fact that they were all from many different places originally,” he said. “But they were all living around the Atlanta area [at the time of casting]. The reason that we did that was because we wanted to give these people a real shot at making their relationships work for the long term.”</p><p>He continued, “Whether you think [love] is going to happen or not, we wanted people that would be ready to be married. If you’re really in it—genuinely in it, which was the No. 1 casting criteria—it felt to us that it was too much of a bridge for someone living in Miami and someone living in Seattle to build. We thought let’s at least start with them in the same geographical area.”</p><p>Coelen also explained to <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2020 about why he wanted each Love Is Blind season to cast contestants from the same city. “We wanted people to all be living, currently in the same place. It’s too difficult if you’re from Tampa and they’re from Portland, that just throws another wrench in. We wanted to give them a real shot at making their love and their marriage working,” he said. Coelen also told Variety at the time about the locations he was looking at for future Love Is Blind seasons. “Look, the idea is that ultimately we’re going to do this in other countries—it’s very global. There’s lots of places that that we could take it. Chicago is a great place to look at, so is New York, Boston, Houston. There’s so many different places that we could go. And like I said, outside of the country as well,” he said.</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Oprah</a> magazine in 2020 that The Pods lasted around 10 days, which started with a series of speed dates between contestants that lasted between eight to 12 minutes. We did a ranking system, from who you though was most compatible to least compatible after the first date. Every day, the list got shorter and shorter,” Love Is Blind season 1 contestant Mark Cuevas told Oprah magazine at the time. Coelen also told Oprah magazine made the cast smaller a few days into the The Pods stage to focus on the contestants forming “real connections.” “We ended up focusing on people who were really forming real connections,” he said.</p><p>Though the dates started short, Coelen told Variety that the producers allowed contestants to have longer dates once they saw how strong their connections were. “In the beginning nobody knew who anybody was. So we structured it so that they would have an opportunity to talk to everyone. They were never given any instruction on what to say or what not to say or what they could ask about or what they couldn’t ask about. And you see on the show, some people decided to [ask] ‘How tall are you, what do you look like?'” he said. “Other people were like, ‘Why would I ever do that? That’s not the point of this.’ We really wanted it to be their own story, their own journey. We would set it up so they had the opportunity to talk to everybody. Then from that point [it was monitored]. Let’s say somebody really wanted to talk to you and you’re like, ‘Yeah, I have no interest in that person.'”</p><p>He continued, “You’re not going to talk to them. It doesn’t matter. We’re not going to arrange people to speak to one another where somebody’s like, ‘yeah, I don’t want to talk to that person.’ We just wouldn’t do that. Multiple points throughout the day we had to break and they had to eat, go to the bathroom, go do interviews, but generally we wanted to give them as much time in the pods as possible with the people that they genuinely wanted to talk to. These dates are obviously cut down but they were hours and hours and hours long.”</p><h2>Who are the Love Is Blind season 3 hosts?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nick-Vanessa-Lachey-Love-Is-Blind.png><p>The Love Is Blind season 3 hosts are Nick Lachey and Vanessa Lachey, who have hosted the series since it premiered in February 2020. The couple also hosted season 1 of Netflix’s The Ultimatum. Nick was the lead singer of the boy band 98 Degrees from 1996 to 2012. The group reunited in 2012 and are still together. Nick has also released four solo alums: SoulO, What’s Left of Me, A Father’s Lullaby and Soundtrack of My Life. He was married to Jessica Simpson from 2002 to 2006, and the two also starred in their own reality show, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica on MTV, from 2003 to 2005. Nick is also the winner of season 5 of The Masked Singer&nbsp;during which he performed as the character “Piglet.” Vanessa was the 1998 Miss Teen USA and was a correspondent for Entertainment Tonight and Total Request Live on MTV. She’s the current lead in CBS’ NCIS spinoff, NCIS: Hawai’i, which premiered in 2021.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Distractify</a> in March 2022, Nick explained that he and Vanessa wanted to host Love Is Blind because of how their own relationship was long distance when they first started dating. “When Netflix approached us with Love is Blind all those years ago, we jumped at the opportunity because the show really spoke to us personally,” Nick said. “When we first started dating, Vanessa was in New York and I was in Los Angeles. We didn’t get to see each other a lot so we had a lot of long phone conversations, learning everything we possibly could about each other.” He continued, “[Those conversations were] really important for building our relationship and knowing we wanted the same things before there were external pressures on the relationship.” Nick also told Distractify that he and Vanessa want contestants to “fall in love for the right reasons and then introduce everything else.”</p><p>Nick also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 about how he thinks Love Is Blind would’ve worked for him and Vanessa if they had met in The Pods.&nbsp;“We’ve thought about that, often. And I really, I’m not just saying this for the benefit of this show, I think we would’ve,” he said. “We have the same birthday, we have the same passions, we have the same interests, we have the same drive. Things that motivated us.” Vanessa asked “You would’ve found me through a wall?” to which Nick responded, “I would find you anywhere.” He continued, “I really do think we would’ve found each other. I think we would’ve gravitated to each other. That’s what we did in life. Obviously, we knew each other.” Vanessa added, “We did. We had to find our journey to get to each other.”</p><p>Nick also claimed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us <span>Weekly</span></a><span>&nbsp;in 2022 that he would’ve joined Love Is Blind if he was single. “I would. I mean, it’s fascinating,” he said. “Especially having seen the success of season 1 and seeing two loving couples still married to this day?
