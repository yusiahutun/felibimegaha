They arrived in France for a year before obtaining American passports and relocating to the United States. They initially settled in Pennsylvania but then relocated to Virginia, where Ava spent most of her youth.</p><p>Ava <strong>grew up hearing her mother sing opera</strong> pieces and aspired to do the same, which prompted her to seek a music career. Ava was also heavily influenced by celebrities from the 1990s and 2000s, including Madonna, Gwen Stefani, Fergie, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Whitney Houston, and <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title="Mariah Carey" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Mariah Carey</a>.</p><p>The singer began writing her first songs when she was just ten years old, and her first musical performance was in a venue called The NorVa in Virginia, where she grew up. As a youngster, she began her career by creating songs, producing covers, singing at local events, and sharing her work online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Eva-Max-Photo-300x300.jpg><p>Ava recognized her talent and how she might become a singer at 14 after winning many local music competitions. She made a list of the assistance of Pharrell Williams, who provided her with advice. Inspired by her family’s courageous decision to flee their war-torn nation, she finally opted to relocate with the family to Los Angeles, California, to realize her goal.</p><p>Ava then relocated to<strong> New York City to pursue a musical career</strong>, and at the age of <strong>17</strong>, she relocated permanently to Los Angeles. Max did not put on many shows for several years, and things did not turn out how she and her family had hoped.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Personal_Life><strong>Personal Life</strong></span></h3><p>Max has claimed she is “100% Albanian” and “certainly wants to contribute back to the Albanian community when I can” about her ethnic origin.</p><p>In a 2019 interview with Attitude, Max claimed that she has previously been attracted to women but has opted not to identify her sexuality, adding, “I like it when it focuses on who you are as a person. I despise it when people put me or anybody I know in a box.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Career><strong>Career</strong></span></h3><p>Ava Max made her <strong>professional debut in 2017</strong> with the track “<strong>Clap Your Hands</strong>,” which she co-wrote with producer Le Youth. The song was an instant summer smash. Her first solo song, “My Way,” was released in April of the following year. Atlantic Records released it. My Way’s official video has been seen over a million times on YouTube.</p><p>It also inspired a remixed version with Julius Jetson. Max then released “<strong>Not Your Barbie Girl</strong>” and “Slippin,” which featured rapper Gashi. She co-wrote and sang on Witt Lowry’s hit “Into Your Arms.” In June 2018, she uploaded an acoustic version on her YouTube channel. Her second single, “Salt,” was released in July of this year.</p><p>In August 2018, Ava Max’s<strong> debut single “Sweet but Psycho”</strong> hit the airways. It was number one in six countries, including Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. It peaked at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles list. Cirkut, a Canadian producer, created Sweet but Psycho (worked with <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title="The Weeknd" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>The Weeknd</a>, Rihanna, etc.).</p><p>Shomi Patwary, a filmmaker, directed the accompanying music video. Within the first three months, it had over 13 million views. Ava Max appeared on the tune “Let It Be Me” from David Guetta’s seventh studio album, 7th (2018). Her next appearance was on Vice and Jason Derulo’s “Makeup.” Max is now signed to Atlantic Records and Full Stop Management. Harry Styles, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title="Gwen Stefani" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Gwen Stefani</a>, and Meghan Trainor are among those who have resided at Full Stop.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Fun_Facts><strong>Fun Facts&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><ul><li>Ava Max (Amanda Ava Koci) is a singer and songwriter of Albanian descent.</li><li>Ava grew up hearing her mother sing opera pieces and aspired to do the same, which prompted her to seek a music career.</li><li>The singer began writing her first songs when she was just ten years old, and her first musical performance was in a venue called The NorVa in Virginia, where she grew up.</li><li>Ava recognized her talent and how she might become a singer at 14 after winning many local music competitions.</li><li>Ava Max made her professional debut in 2017 with the track “Clap Your Hands,” which she co-wrote with producer Le Youth.
