Netizens were taken aback by the couple’s relationship and how grown their children are.</p><p>Here’s a look at the life of their second daughter, Romy Hero Johnson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Romy_Hero_Johnson></span>Who Is Romy Hero Johnson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Romy Hero Johnson is the second daughter of Aaron and Sam Taylor-Johnson. Romy Hero Johnson was born at home on Wednesday, January 18, 2012, in London, as confirmed by her parents’ representatives at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lh5.googleusercontent.com/JpRLmFmC6YDyc4ipCn7O4T-l5-08VHL-Hzv0UnolhHWTfYU8GtCy4aTrpYIoJ_KwpxWknR-vXCvEu0XE9FqVWdDDiMuHVYAxPBE0iBHFH0O4hJsVS99muJd9HRZK2UWvqfB4C2cITdH7Bjo1Z4PbY24><p>Aaron and Sam are known for their wide age gap, which brought them much public attention. However, their daughter remains a non-public figure. The couple was already parents to daughter <a href=#>Wylda Rae</a> when they gave birth to Romy. Romy has two other step-sisters, Jessie and Angelica, who her Sam’s daughters with ex-husband Jay Jopling.</p><p>Like Romy, Wylda Rae Johnson was&nbsp;also born&nbsp;in London on July 7, 2010. Aaron was only 20 years old when she was born, while Sam was 43 years old.&nbsp;It would be hard to imagine what the dynamics of that relationship must have been at that time.</p><p>For Aaron to become a father to Romy, Wylda, and his stepdaughters at such a young age seem unimaginable, especially because there was still much growing up to do at that age. However, Aaron seems to have been born with an all-you-need-to-know manual because he excels at it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Romy_Hero_Johnson_Comes_From_a_Family_of_Creatives></span>Romy Hero Johnson Comes From a Family of Creatives<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Romy comes from a creative family of entertainers, which will make it no surprise if she decides to follow that path. Her mother is a known director, producer, and photographer, while her father is an actor.</p><p>She also has an uncle, Kristan Taylor-Wood, who is just like her mother, a photographer and director. Romy’s older sister, Angelica, is an art exhibitor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Little_About_Romy_Hero_Johnsons_Parents></span>A Little About Romy Hero Johnson’s Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Romy’s parents are an interesting couple. They have a 23-year age gap, which was a major factor in their fame in 2012. The couple married in 2012 after meeting in 2009 on the set of Sam’s film “Nowhere Boy.”</p><p>Their first child together, Wylda, was welcomed in 2010, and Romy two years later. Sam has two other daughters, Angelica and Jessie, from her 11-year marriage to art dealer Jay Jopling, which ended in 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/618312418a14fcbe61b70d923ee57c33-fotor-20230615202850.jpg><p>In June 2022, Sam shared a loved-up snap to celebrate ten years of marriage, She dubbed her husband ‘father to all four girls.’</p><p>She <a href=#>wrote</a>: “10 glorious years — my incredible husband and father to all four girls. I love you; I love you, I love you. Love conquers all.” Sam and Aaron decided to renew their vows with their friends and family in honor of the marriage milestone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Detailed_Timeline_of_Aaron_and_Sams_Relationship></span>Detailed Timeline of Aaron and Sam’s Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The couple met in 2008 when Aaron was interested in auditioning for Sam’s directorial project. While reflecting on that experience in 2019, <a href=#>Sam said</a>, “I knew instantly — I could see how much research he’d done already just by the way he was standing and the few words he said.”</p><p>After filming for “Nowhere Boy” wrapped, the actor popped the question to Sam. In Sam’s <a href=#>words</a>, “We were very professional through the entire film, but everyone on set knew. And as soon as we finished, he told me he would marry me. We had never been on a date or even kissed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/b82ecc4762c13fcdaf3715477fda04d5.jpg><p>“Nowhere Boy” premiered at the London Film Festival on October 29, 2009, with the new couple arriving arm in arm. The director’s daughters, Angelica and Jessie Phoenix, also attended the premiere at Odeon Leicester Square.</p><p>In 2010, the newly engaged couple confirmed they were expecting their first child together. “We can confirm that Sam is pregnant with her and Aaron’s first child. Both are very, very happy,” a spokesperson for the pair shared.</p><p>Ahead of their first child’s arrival, Aaron <a href=#>shared that he was feeling excited</a> about fatherhood. He said, “I’ve got a wonderful woman, she’s lovely, and she’s a fantastic mother. It’s not scary, I’m already a stepdad to [Sam’s kids Angelica and Jessie]. So the nerves have sort of gone.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Romy_Hero_Johnson_Is_Growing_Up_With_Her_Parents_Love_and_Care></span>Romy Hero Johnson Is Growing Up With Her Parent’s Love and Care<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Romy’s parents ensure they give her the love and support she needs. Although many once talked about their relationship because of the <a href=#>age gap</a>, Sam and Aaron proved that love overshadows age. Since meeting in 2008, their relationship has only gotten stronger and better.&nbsp;</p><p>Aaron admitted that all his children were pretty smart and that he had learned much from them. In an interview, he said, “Being honest with your kids is most important, really. They know when you’re lying for sure. I learn more from my kids than anyone else. They are incredibly smart, and they’re sweet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02aYmqqfo3qiusNmqpqlXamuurjOq2Sjp5ijwLC60maqnpufo7FusMCunqGslad6s7vMsmShnaKkequ7x6eqqKZf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeet-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-second-daughter-romy-hero-johnson.html&text=Meet%20Aaron%20and%20Sam-Taylor%20Johnsons%20Second%20Daughter%2c%20Romy%20Hero%20Johnson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-second-daughter-romy-hero-johnson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-second-daughter-romy-hero-johnson.html&title=Meet%20Aaron%20and%20Sam-Taylor%20Johnsons%20Second%20Daughter%2c%20Romy%20Hero%20Johnson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeet-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-second-daughter-romy-hero-johnson.html&title=Meet%20Aaron%20and%20Sam-Taylor%20Johnsons%20Second%20Daughter%2c%20Romy%20Hero%20Johnson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-second-daughter-romy-hero-johnson.html&title=Meet%20Aaron%20and%20Sam-Taylor%20Johnsons%20Second%20Daughter%2c%20Romy%20Hero%20Johnson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-aaron-and-sam-taylor-johnsons-second-daughter-romy-hero-johnson.html&description=Meet%20Aaron%20and%20Sam-Taylor%20Johnsons%20Second%20Daughter%2c%20Romy%20Hero%20Johnson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./meghan-markle-fashion-outfit-details-christmas-lunch-buckingham-palace.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meghan Markle turns heads in diamonds and ruffles at the Queen's Christmas lunch">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lola-flanery-bio-age-nationality-height-parents-personal-life-details-bio-age-birthday-parents-nationality-height-father-mother-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lola Flanery Bio: Age, Nationality, Height, Parents - Personal Life Details">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
