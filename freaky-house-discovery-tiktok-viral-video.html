After finding a secret storage area, she found there was yet another room behind a brick wall -- and spotted a silver suitcase in the distance.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>After "walking around like a crazy person" trying to find another entrance to that hidden room, she eventually found an access hatch in the back of another closet ... which led to a boarded up "cupboard" she was too "scared" to open until her husband got home.</p><p>In a third video, her husband was seen finally accessing the secret room and grabbing the suitcase -- as she noted how viewers were going "absolutely crazy" wanting to know what was inside.</p><p>"It was light, so we didn't think it was a dead body ... outside the super obvious points of there being no hideous smell and there were no flies either," she added.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>They then opened the suitcase, to find another, smaller one inside -- as the couple's dog showed up and seemed "a little bit scared to see what was in there." Then, finally, they cracked open the smaller case and found "a strange doll" secured under its straps.</p><p>"It's nothing from a horror movie or anything out of the ordinary, but it is a really strange doll, it could be a collectible," the woman noted, before showing off the figure, which donned a crochet-style pink dress. "It is a little bit weird, especially because it was strapped in. I don't know how I feel about that."</p><p>She went on to call the doll "very disturbing," adding that their dog wasn't amused by the discovery.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>Viewers were clearly concerned they had unleashed a new Annabelle into the world, as most of them told the couple to put both the doll and the suitcase back where they found it.</p><p>"Na they locked it in there for a reason ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ we only just got into 2024 pleaseeeee put it back ðŸ˜­" wrote one follower. "the fact the dog was unsure before u even opened it ðŸ˜³" wrote another, before someone else shared a similar sentiment by commenting, "That doll is haunted and the dog knows it ðŸ˜­"</p><p>The comments continued, with people leaving posts like, "We've all just witnessed the start of the movie," "Keep us updated on what you have awoken please" and "Seriously u need to find the lady that collects haunted dolls, that was in the cases for a reason."</p><p>"Could be a haunted or cursed doll and thatâ€™s why itâ€™s locked away," wrote someone else.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>In their fourth and final video, the homeowner thanked fans for doing "welfare checks" on them since their discovery ... and revealed some of their concerned viewers may have a point.</p><p>"We have noticed a few strange things occurring. The electrics, for instance, directly underneath where the doll was found have started to flicker," she revealed. "Also, the thermostat has been making some questionable noises."</p><p>She added that, as a number of the commenters noted, the doll actually appeared to be a toilet paper roll cover ... and matched a pink bathroom in the home.</p><p>"We don't know if the things happening in the house were a coincidence or whether they are, in fact, tied to the doll," she concluded. "She has found a new home for now, but we're not entirely sure what we're doing with her."</p><p>The video in which they found the doll was racked up more than 2.1 million views since it was posted last week.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8b346986-e579-4770-b0cd-dc463ecc0418 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ac40228d-b194-4f0f-8ecb-5f71e9e5cb03 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/25/5by4/2023/11/03/258697c56e624ab796b6c1a77c7d5479_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Reddit</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Home Camera Captures Ghost-like Apparition While Owner Is Away on Business</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmamhfm7%2BmrcqyZKGnpaiybrDIrJqorpWnxm7AyKSrqKNdq7azrctmraKclaR8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffreaky-house-discovery-tiktok-viral-video.html&text=%27Strange%20Things%27%20Start%20Happening%20After%20Homeowners%20Find%20%27Very%20Disturbing%27%20Object%20Inside%20Hidden%20Suitca&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffreaky-house-discovery-tiktok-viral-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffreaky-house-discovery-tiktok-viral-video.html&title=%27Strange%20Things%27%20Start%20Happening%20After%20Homeowners%20Find%20%27Very%20Disturbing%27%20Object%20Inside%20Hidden%20Suitca" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffreaky-house-discovery-tiktok-viral-video.html&title=%27Strange%20Things%27%20Start%20Happening%20After%20Homeowners%20Find%20%27Very%20Disturbing%27%20Object%20Inside%20Hidden%20Suitca" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffreaky-house-discovery-tiktok-viral-video.html&title=%27Strange%20Things%27%20Start%20Happening%20After%20Homeowners%20Find%20%27Very%20Disturbing%27%20Object%20Inside%20Hidden%20Suitca" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffreaky-house-discovery-tiktok-viral-video.html&description=%27Strange%20Things%27%20Start%20Happening%20After%20Homeowners%20Find%20%27Very%20Disturbing%27%20Object%20Inside%20Hidden%20Suitca" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hawkeyes-2023-kid-captains-announced.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hawkeyes 2023 Kid Captains announced">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vanessa-bayer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Vanessa Bayer dating?
