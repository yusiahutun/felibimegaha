We often don’t know where it comes from, only that it springs up out of nowhere and washes over us in a way we can’t control. Understanding <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how to tell if you know someone from a past life</a> could explain why you feel so drawn to a specific person. At some point, we’ve all met someone that impacts us on a far deeper level than we ever could have imagined. It will even shine a light on the relationship dynamics you share with them now.</p><p>If you believe in reincarnation, you know the soul continues beyond death. You know that this life is just one of countless lives you’ve already lived before. And with each life, your soul accumulates karma and learns new things along the way. One of the main ways we learn is by teaching each other, as relationships are the cornerstone of our experience here on Earth. Chances are, the people who teach you the most are the same people who have taught you in the past, as you’ve been together during many different incarnations. When you meet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a lover, friend, family member</a> or even enemy from a past life, there’s a subconscious part of you that will be able to recognize them.</p><p>Before we are born, we commune with our soul family and make plans to find each other during our next incarnation. And when you finally do meet, everything begins falling into place. By <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">loving and challenging each other</a>, we are able to accelerate our growth and sort through the karma leftover from our past lives. It is by provoking, influencing and impacting each other’s lives that we are able to teach each other the lessons we came here to learn.</p><p>Brian Weiss—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a pioneer of past life regression hypnotherapy</a>—once said: “Sometimes, soulmates may meet, stay together until a task or life lesson is completed, and then move on. This is not a tragedy, only a matter of learning.” If someone suddenly crashes into your world like a tsunami, there’s a strong chance you knew them in a past life. And it means you’re on the brink of something incredible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><p>Here are 11 signs that you knew someone in a past life, because it can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>bring clarity to a relationship</a> that feels intense, confusing, beautiful, and at times, even heartbreaking.

If this strange sensation comes over you upon meeting someone, it’s a strong indicator that your souls are well acquainted with each other. After all, the soul is both timeless and infinite, and just because you haven’t met them in this life doesn’t mean you’ve never known them in your precious ones.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.836902800659><h2>They Elicit a Strong Reaction From You</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lovehoroscope8-8-22_1-1.png><p>We make soul contracts with each other before we’re born, vowing to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">teach each other specific lessons</a> and help us on our life journey. That feeling of recognition is there for a reason, as it pulls you in. You were meant to meet this person and your intense curiosity about them is what will allow you to pick up where you left off. If you meet someone and your relationship begins with an intense level of passion, conflict, desire, anger, joy or distress, there’s a strong chance you share soul ties.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4626400996264><h2>You Immediately Form a Deep Bond</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lovehoroscopemay2023.png><p>One thing that’s true for every karmic relationship—<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it starts off strong</a>. If you find yourself all wrapped up in a whirlwind romance that’s passionate enough to make you jump into a longterm commitment, there’s a chance your souls are just way too excited about your reunion. If you’re suddenly involved in a major conflict with another person you just met, it’s also possible that you share a complicated spiritual history with their soul. Perhaps you were not on good terms in your previous life and you’re sorting through your karma together. Often, our children and family members are also people we knew in our past lives, which explains the deep bond we immediately form with them!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.48064516129032><h2>You Have an Intuitive & Telepathic Connection</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/lovehoroscopefeb2023.png><p>When you meet someone you share a long spiritual history with, it’s as if there’s already a deeper understanding between you. It’s as if you already understand things about them that you shouldn’t. There’s no need to fill every moment of silence with words. You don’t feel pressured into <a href=#>keeping them entertained</a> or putting on a front in their presence. You can literally communicate with each other with a simple look, knowing that whatever is on your mind will be immediately sensed by them.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9390862944162><h2>You Can't Seem to Stay Away From Each Other</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lovehoroscopemarch.png><p>No matter how hard you try, leaving a person you share soul ties with will never be easy. This could manifest as an on-again off-again relationship in which a breakup just never seems to stick, as though a cosmic force beyond your control is constantly bringing you back together. It could unfold like a divorce that’s so long and drawn out, you’re beginning to feel like it will ever end. It could even manifest as a rivalry that consumes a large portion of your time and energy, as though you’re both addicted to hating each other or obsessing over each other. On the plus side, it can also manifest <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as a loving relationship</a> that lasts until your very last breath.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4056603773585><h2>Time Doesn't Exist When You're Together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/astro-couple.jpg><p>Because the connection you share with someone from a past life can be so deep, it often feels like you’re the only two people in the world when you’re together. Time seems to stop <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when you’re in each other’s presence</a>, as if the whole universe is fading away and you can’t focus on anything but each other. After all, encountering a person that you knew in a past life is a climactic moment, because your souls likely planned this meeting long ago. The reason you can’t focus on anything else is because they’re the main event!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9055118110236><h2>Your Relationship Is Teaching You Difficult Lessons</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/weeklyhoroscope10-28-22.png><p>One thing that every past life connection has in common is that it’s always an intense and often difficult experience. There’s always karma attached to the people you share soul ties with, which is why you were brought back together again in this life. Chances are, there is still unresolved drama from your past lives that is still being worked out between you. Karmic relationships <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can often feel confusing</a>, overwhelming, all-encompassing and beyond heart-breaking. After all, you share a long history together, and as much as you might want to get away from them, the thought of losing them all over again might feel just as awful.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.91851851851852><h2>Your Birth Charts Say You Do</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/birth-chart-3.jpg><p>The easiest way to find out if you knew someone in a past life is to look into your astrological birth charts and the way they affect each other. Because the South Node dictates <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who and where we’ve been in our past lives</a>, it’s the first place to look to when trying to understand our karmic history. If you have planets in your chart that form a conjunction, opposition, square or trine with someone’s South Node—and vice versa—there’s no doubt you were together in a past life.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Your Tarot Cards Say You Do</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/weeklytarotscope.png><p>Another great way to gain a deeper understanding of how long you’ve really known someone is by asking your tarot cards.

Your heart knows exactly what is familiar to you and what is not.
