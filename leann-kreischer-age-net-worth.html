As of 2019, her age is 48 years old with the birth sign Leo.</p><p>She was raised in Bowdon and spent a lot of time in her home state before she relocated to Los Angeles. She spent her childhood in a small village. Kreischer holds an American nationality and her ethnicity is white. LeAnn Kreischer stands at the height of 5 feet 7 inches and average weight. She has brown eyes and black hair.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_LeeAnn_Kreischer_Husband><span id=Who_is_Karly_Skladany_Husband><span id=What_is_Kim_Carton_Net_Worth_and_Salary>Who is LeeAnn Kreischer Husband?<br></span></span></span></h2><p>When you are the subject of a lot of your husband’s comedy routines, you are bound to become a famous name. LeeAnn Kreischer’s relationship with her husband is as interesting as the personality of her husband<strong> Bert Kreischer</strong>.</p><p>To start off, they met three times before they started any form of meaningful relationship. The first two times, Bert Kreischer failed to make any positive impression on LeeAnn, and in fact, made zero impressions the second time because LeeAnn never gave him her attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biogossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/asd.jpg><p>The third time proved to be the magic number as a party organized by Bert’s writing partner at the time gave her a chance to recognize the existence of Bert and who he truly was. Her curiosity drove her to give him her number and although she never expected to marry him due to his wild nature, that eventually proved to be the case.</p><p>Interestingly, the popular comedian who has no problem running around a school campus naked was too shy and nervous to call LeeAnn after he got her number, prompting LeeAnn to make the call herself, demanding an explanation.</p><p>One thing eventually led to another and they started off on their first date, the second and the third, and then eventually ended up at the altar in December 2003.</p><p>Since they got married, LeeAnn Kreischer and her husband have been able to raise two children, daughters who were born in 2004 and 2006. Their first daughter is named <strong>Georgia</strong> while the second is named <strong>Ila</strong>.</p><h2><span id=What_is_LeeAnn_Kreischer_Net_Worth_and_Salary><span id=What_is_Bernadette_Robi_Net_Worth_and_Salary><span id=What_is_Karly_Skladany_Net_Worth_and_Salary><span id=What_is_Kim_Carton_Net_Worth_and_Salary>What is LeeAnn Kreischer Net Worth and Salary?</span></span></span></span></h2><p>LeeAnn has earned a decent amount of money throughout her career. However, she has not provided her net worth and salary in the media. Besides her net worth being the wife of famous celebrity she certainly enjoys the fortune from her husband. Therefore her husband Bert Kreischer is an American stand-up comedian, actor, and reality television host who has a net worth of <strong>$3 million as of 2022.</strong></p><p>His major source of income comes from his profession as an actor, TV show host, and stand-up comedian. He is also an author and the income from his book sales is also the main source of income that adds to his net worth. With income coming from his multiple careers, it’s no surprise that Bert’s net worth will be in million in the coming future.</p><p>Other complimentary income comes from appearances in movies and as a television host. LeeAnn set up a fundraiser on Facebook for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. She has so far raised <strong>$155.00</strong> towards her <strong>$200.00</strong> goal. The couple is living their simple life together with their children.</p><h2><span id=Career><span id=Nicole_Garippos_Height_and_Weight><span id=Tamara_Gilmer8217s_Height_and_Weight>Career</span></span></span></h2><ul><li>LeAnn as a writer has worked on the short film, Destiny Stalled which was released in 2000.</li><li>However, more than her professional works, she is most prominently known as the wife of the party man, Bert Kreischer.
