By the beginning of the year, the couple had already filed for divorce (for the second time) and Megan had gone public with her new beau <a href=#>Machine Gun Kelly</a>.</p><p>Here's all that went down between Megan and Brian this year…</p><p><strong>Brian Requests Joint Custody Of Their Children</strong></p><p>At the end of 2020, Brian filed a petition for joint legal and physical custody of the estranged couple's three children -- Bodhi, 7, Noah, 9, and Journey, 5. His filing came at the same time Megan filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences as the cause.</p><p><strong>Brian Goes Public With Girlfriend Sharna Burgess</strong></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>In January, Brian sparked dating rumors with "Dancing With The Stars" pro <a href=#>Sharna Burgess</a> after they were spotted on a tropical vacation together. Following weeks of speculation, Brian and Sharna made things Instagram official, sharing a photo from their holiday vacay.</p><p>Brian later revealed that he and Sharna had begun dating a few months prior after being connected by their shared business manager. He <a href=#><u>explained</u></a> that meeting her "was something I'd never experienced before in my life” and “noticeably different from anything” else.</p><p><strong>Brian Posts a Seemingly Shady PDA Selfie With Sharna</strong></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>After several months of dating, Brian shared a PDA-packed photo kissing Sharna during a trip to Walt Disney World. In the caption, he reflected on his relationship with Sharna and some fans speculated that his comment was throwing shade at the time he spent with Megan.</p><p>"It's been a really long time since I've been with someone I can truly share life with," Brian wrote.</p><p>Comments flooded in from fans, questioning Brian's motive with the caption and wondering if he was intentionally implying that he had not been able to truly share his life with Megan.</p><p><strong>Megan Comments on Brian & Sharna’s Photo</strong></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Amid the speculation surrounding Brian's caption, Megan chimed in with her own comment which also left fans puzzled. Megan simply wrote "Grateful for Sharna," adding in a purple heart emoji. In response, some fans commented that she sounded "bitter" about the situation while others thought that she was throwing shade back at Brian.</p><p><strong>Brian Clarifies The Drama</strong></p><p>Brian and Megan's Instagram interaction immediately made headlines -- and it was enough that the actor felt that he needed to step in and say something. In an Instagram Story, Brian clarified that he didn't mean any harm by his caption and implied that Megan was being sincere.</p><p>"For people that need or want clarification, Megan and I get along great. Neither of us are sending petty digs to each other. We both work really hard to get along and coparent [sic] well for our kids," Brian <a href=#><u>wrote</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Brian & Megan Finalize Their Divorce</strong></p><p>Things seemed to have settled down between Brian and Megan as they focused on their children and both of their new relationships. In October, the former couple reportedly reached a divorce settlement and are waiting on a judge to sign off on the paperwork. According to <a href=#><u>TMZ</u></a>, the docs state that the couple will share joint custody of their children and since they never signed a prenup, they will also share anything acquired during their 10-year marriage.</p><a id=gallery-link-0c70d028-8fa6-49c8-a4c8-7868379c2b52 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:0c70d028-8fa6-49c8-a4c8-7868379c2b52 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:9ee05de5-d135-442e-9ad7-c45da9d29005 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/20/4by3/2021/12/13/20af16d3fce84368bb65f94c8dfa13f5_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGtmbGhflrmtedOhnGallZyur3nFqK9mmZ6ZeqO%2ByJqlZpmlqMGquoygqZ6dnmKxs63MmmSyp6ViuqLFjKGYr51dora0v8SdZK2gmah6urHAq2Y%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fall-the-megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green-drama-you-may-have-missed-this-year.html&text=Megan%20Fox%2c%20Brian%20Austin%20Green%20Drama%3a%202021%20Edition&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-the-megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green-drama-you-may-have-missed-this-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-the-megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green-drama-you-may-have-missed-this-year.html&title=Megan%20Fox%2c%20Brian%20Austin%20Green%20Drama%3a%202021%20Edition" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fall-the-megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green-drama-you-may-have-missed-this-year.html&title=Megan%20Fox%2c%20Brian%20Austin%20Green%20Drama%3a%202021%20Edition" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fall-the-megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green-drama-you-may-have-missed-this-year.html&title=Megan%20Fox%2c%20Brian%20Austin%20Green%20Drama%3a%202021%20Edition" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-the-megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green-drama-you-may-have-missed-this-year.html&description=Megan%20Fox%2c%20Brian%20Austin%20Green%20Drama%3a%202021%20Edition" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./all-watch-residents-massive-wildfire-burned-washington-town-ground-fears-grow-wall-fire-claim-second-community-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pateros, Washington, residents describe how wildfire burned town to the ground">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gary-morris-to-step-in-for-connie-smith-and-marty-stuart-on-the-opry.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gary Morris To Step In For Connie Smith And Marty Stuart On The Opry">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
