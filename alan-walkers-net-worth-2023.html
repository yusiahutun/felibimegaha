as Omar LinX, Migos, Ookay, Selena Gomez, Jauz, and Slushii.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span><strong>Early Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christopher Comstock was born on the 19th of May 1992, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p><p>There is little other info on his background and life before music.</p><p>Hopefully, we will get to hear more about this side of his life in the years to come.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3>DJ and Music <a href=#>Producer</a></h3><p>Marshmello is a hugely talented DJ and music <a href=#>producer</a> with numerous certified multi-platinum hits that appeared in the Billboard Hot 100 Top 300.</p><p>Managed by Moe Shalizi, Marshmello’s musical style includes groove-oriented, synth, and bass-heavy electronic dance music.</p><h3>Early Career</h3><p>Starting in 2015, Marshmello built his reputation off the back of popular song remixes which he released online, building a dedicated fanbase.</p><p>Having established himself in the electronic music scene, he released his debut album, “Joytime,” showcasing his original music and production skills.</p><p>The album was a defining moment in his career as it established Marshmello as a highly skilled <a href=#>musician</a> with a unique, groove-oriented style.</p><p>‘Keep it Mello” was the album’s lead single, featuring a collaboration with Mexican rapper, Omar Linx who contributed to the song’s energetic sound.</p><p>A game-changing moment for Marshmello occurred with the release of his <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href=https://www.billboard.com/charts/dance-electronic-streaming-songs/2017-02-04/ data-lasso-id=138606 data-wpel-link=external data-cke-saved->Platinum-certified hit</a>, “Alone,” which achieved success in the <a href=#>USA</a> and Canada.</p><h3>Live Performances</h3><p>A key component of Marshmello’s success was his appearance at live events, including various music festivals which helped him connect with his audience.</p><p>His appearances at events like Miami Music Week, HARD Day of the Dead festival in Pomona, and New York’s Pier 94 massively expanded his reach.</p><p>It wasn’t long before established artists like Skrillex took notice of his phenomenal work, re-posting his song “Find Me” on SoundCloud and endorsing his work.</p><p>With his increasing visibility worldwide, Marshmello maintained his hidden identity, appearing in public with a custom white helmet resembling a marshmallow.</p><p>With his true identity remaining a closely guarded secret, he achieved notable success on Billboard’s charts, peaking at number five on the Dance/Electronic

captivating music and enigmatic persona created a real sense of intrigue and excitement among an ever-increasing number of fans.</p><p>This laid the foundation for his continued success in the music industry, resulting in a host of highly successful collaborations with other mainstream musicians.</p><p>His hookup with <a href=#>American</a> R&B <a href=#>singer</a>, Khalid, resulted in the hit single “Silence,” which was released in August 2017 through RCA Records.</p><p>The song achieved both platinum and multi-platinum certifications in numerous countries, solidifying Marshmello’s status as a top-tier electronic music <a href=#>producer</a>.</p><h3>Collaboration Successes</h3><p>His next move was to team up with global pop icon, Selena Gomez, late in 2017, releasing the chart-topping single “Wolves.”</p><p>The single achieved huge success across the world, becoming one of his most commercially successful songs and catapulting him into the mainstream music scene.</p><p>He then followed this success with a successful collaboration hit, “Friends,” a catchy, upbeat track with relatable lyrics featuring British <a href=#>singer</a>, Anne-Marie.</p><h3>Worldwide Tours</h3><p>Marshmello embarked on the “Ritual Tour,” performing in various countries, including the United States, China, South Korea, <a href=#>India</a>, and Paraguay.</p><p>His global tour allowed him to connect more intimately with diverse audiences across cultures and languages, solidifying his international fan base.</p><h3>Record Label Owner</h3><p>Building on his phenomenal worldwide success, Marshmello founded a record label, “Joytime Collective,” allowing him to release his own music.</p><p>His label also gave him access to emerging artists, whom he could support and promote, contributing to the growth of the entire electronic music community.</p><p>Marshmello continued to collaborate with electronic music producers, releasing singles like “Chasing Colors” with <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ookay_discography data-lasso-id=138609 data-wpel-link=external data-cke-saved->Ookay</a> and Slushii’s, “Twinbow.”</p><p>“Moving On” was his next emotional single, with the song’s music video receiving millions of views and resonating with fans across the globe.</p><p>He’s announced upcoming collaborations with <a href=#>American</a> hip-hop <a href=#>artist</a> Blackbear and pop star Demi Lovato, generating huge excitement among fans.</p><p>Marshmello released “Love U” as a free single in appreciation of his fans, described as a “gritty dance-pop single with a pounding bass line.”</p><h3>Philanthropist&nbsp;</h3><p>Beyond the electrifying beats and catchy melodies, Marshmello uses his influence and resources to make a positive impact on various charitable causes.</p><p>A notable contribution was teaming up with Fortnite player Tyler “Ninja” Blevins to participate in Epic Games’ E3 <a href=#>Celebrity</a> Pro Am charity tournament.</p><p>Marshmello donated half his $1 million winnings to KIND (Kids in Need of Defense), an organization providing legal counsel to refugees and
