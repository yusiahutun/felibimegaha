The pair were rushed to hospital, where Bandiman’s wife eventually recovered – but doctors were unable to save Naba.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">NA was arrested on April 30 after CCTV footage recovered from outside the mosque captured her interaction with Bandiman. She has been charged with premeditated murder under Article 340 of Indonesia’s Criminal Code, punishments for which can range from 20 years’ imprisonment to death by firing squad.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">SIMILAR CASES</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Strangely, NA’s arrest has drawn parallels to the Hoorn Pie case of 1911, when Indonesia was still under Dutch colonial rule.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That case – which involved a box of poisoned pastries similarly sent to the wrong person in Hoorn, the Netherlands, who subsequently died – is now used by Indonesian law faculties to teach the concept of criminal intent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But while it demonstrates the principle of dolus eventualis, or an awareness of the likely outcome of an action, Indonesian lawmakers argue that the case of the spiked satay presents a number of other legal hurdles and that prosecutors may have trouble convicting NA of premeditated murder.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Aggression in women is no different from that of men, it is just that the motives and ways of committing murder are differentIrna Minauli, criminal and forensic psychologist</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Because the victim in this case [the driver’s son] was mistargeted, the use of Article 340 regarding premeditated murder could be negated, because the crime of premeditated murder was not achieved,” Ermelina Singereta, a lawyer at the Dike Nomia law firm in Jakarta, told This Week In Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But there is another alternative article that can be used, namely Article 338 of the Criminal Code which is unpremeditated murder and carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, because the perpetrator did not have the ‘intention and plan’ to commit the murder of the victim, so the murder was unplanned in advance.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking to the media following NA’s arrest on May 3, the head of the Yogyakarta Police Crime Investigation Division, Burkan Rudy Satria, said “the suspect planned the crime for three months. She bought the poison for 225,000 rupiah (US$16) online”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/05/17/888e35cc-b6b1-11eb-9461-e80e43f535ad_1320x770_191732.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The poison – which Burkan confirmed was cyanide meant to be used to kill rats – has sparked comparisons to the Wongso case, which also involved a cyanide-laced drink, but Irna Minauli, a criminal and forensic psychologist based in Medan, said this similarity was not entirely surprising.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Aggression in women is no different from that of men, it is just that the motives and ways of committing murder are different,” she said. “Men tend to commit murders directly while women commit them indirectly, for example by using someone else as an intermediary. The tools used are also different. Men often use sharp weapons or guns, but women use more indirect methods that don’t kill immediately such as poison.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Minauli added that women tend to kill in ways that reduce the chances of injury or disability to the victim, and that motives for murder can differ for men and women.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“With men, we often see murders as a result of perceived self-esteem issues, and in women we see more cases based on jealousy or revenge,” she said.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">In the context of this case, we have a woman who is also a victim, because she had a relationship with a man who left her without giving a reasonErmelina Singereta, Jakarta-based lawyer</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Revenge was also thought to be the motive in the Wongso murder case, though her lawyers disputed this theory in court and she has always maintained her innocence despite losing all her legal appeals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Regarding NA and the poisoned satay case, Burkan the police investigator told the media that “the motive was that she had a broken heart”. “The perpetrator and Tomy had been in a relationship before he got married [to another woman],” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Studies have shown that women are far less likely to kill than men, with figures compiled by the Home Office in Britain showing that 90 per cent of murders over a 10-year period to 2012 were committed by men. A report from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation also found that 90 per cent of murders were committed by men from 1999 to 2012.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Indonesia’s coffee killer sentenced to 20 years in jail</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawyer Singereta, however, cautioned against looking at the case in absolute legal terms, arguing that it also needs to be examined through the prism of gender equality and the treatment of women.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When a criminal event like this occurs we also need to look at the background of the legal incident. In this case, the alleged perpetrator is a woman who was also the victim of patriarchal attitudes in Indonesia, the absence of gender equality, the abuse of power relations and the existence of a society’s view that men are always right,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In the context of this case, we have a woman who is also a victim, because she had a relationship with a man who left her without giving a reason. The victim’s actions were an act of revenge for the hurt that the victim experienced, because the possible promises made to the victim were not fulfilled.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Poisoned satay case helps stir debate over why women kill</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGpqa2NsfnZ7yKebqKaVqLaiv4yppqKrn6OypXnSmquasV2gtq24yKeeZqCRqHqmr8eonKxlmprAtLXCmmSwp56cwLC%2FjGtnam4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2findonesias-poisoned-satay-killing-has-echoes-jessica-wongsos-2016.html&text=Indonesias%20poisoned-satay%20killing%20has%20echoes%20of%20Jessica%20Wongsos%202016%20cyanide-coffee%20murder%20cas&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2findonesias-poisoned-satay-killing-has-echoes-jessica-wongsos-2016.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2findonesias-poisoned-satay-killing-has-echoes-jessica-wongsos-2016.html&title=Indonesias%20poisoned-satay%20killing%20has%20echoes%20of%20Jessica%20Wongsos%202016%20cyanide-coffee%20murder%20cas" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2findonesias-poisoned-satay-killing-has-echoes-jessica-wongsos-2016.html&title=Indonesias%20poisoned-satay%20killing%20has%20echoes%20of%20Jessica%20Wongsos%202016%20cyanide-coffee%20murder%20cas" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2findonesias-poisoned-satay-killing-has-echoes-jessica-wongsos-2016.html&title=Indonesias%20poisoned-satay%20killing%20has%20echoes%20of%20Jessica%20Wongsos%202016%20cyanide-coffee%20murder%20cas" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2findonesias-poisoned-satay-killing-has-echoes-jessica-wongsos-2016.html&description=Indonesias%20poisoned-satay%20killing%20has%20echoes%20of%20Jessica%20Wongsos%202016%20cyanide-coffee%20murder%20cas" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./interesting-psychology-behind-first-love.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Interesting psychology behind first love">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./doctors-cockroach-vagina-woman-honduras-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Doctors find a cockroach in the VAGINA of woman in Honduras">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
