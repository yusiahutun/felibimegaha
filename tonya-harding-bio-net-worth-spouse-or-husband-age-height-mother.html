The controversial American professional figure skater won the 1994 Winter Olympics by conspiring with her ex-spouse to keep her strongest rival from entering the championship. Tonya was forced to give up her figure skating career when she pleaded guilty to conspiracy in this crime.</p><p>As a result, the former figure skater tried her hand at boxing in 2003 and only had six fights with three wins before her involvement in the sport came to an end. She gained popularity when she began appearing in movies and television shows. Despite her popularity, history will find it hard to forget Tonya Harding’s contributions to the female figure skating culture.</p><h2><strong>Tonya Harding Bio (Age)</strong></h2><p>Tonya Maxine Harding is an American of North American origin. She was born on November 12, 1970, in Portland, Oregon. The former figure skater was born as the daughter of Al Harding and LaVona Golden. She grew up in Portland together with her brother Karl Harding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Tonya-Harding.jpg><p>Tonya attended Milwaukie High School but had to drop out in the second year to concentrate on a career in figure skating. Tonya was successful in the sport for a while, even winning several prizes and championships, but her downfall came in 1994 when she conspired with her ex-husband Jeff to break the legs of her skating rival Nancy Kerrigan and prevent her from participating in the 1994 Winter Olympics.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Alisha Marie, How Old And Tall Is She, Where Does She Live?</a></strong></p><p>The consequences of her acquiescence were the loss of her championship title and finally her expulsion from the US Figure Skating Federation. Falling from the proverbial grace on grass was hard on Tonya Harding. Since her notorious retirement from her lofty position as a championship award winner, the ex-figure skating champion has been trying to find her strength in other careers.</p><h2><strong>Tonya Harding Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The estimated net value of Tonya was set at a ridiculous $30,000. After her forced retirement from skating, she tried her hand at various other professions, including acting, music, and boxing, but all in vain. Tonya Harding even went so far as to work as a welder, saleswoman, and painter. Despite this, she was not able to achieve any significant success in her recent ventures.</p><h2><b>Her Mother</b></h2><p>Tonya’s mother, LaVona Golden, played a very important role in her life, as she was the only one who took care of her daughter after her husband divorced her from her meager income as a waitress. LaVona practically sewed Tonya’s skating costumes, as it was impossible for her to afford one with the meager income they had to survive on.</p><p>The retired figure skater once revealed that her mother physically abused her from time to time. While the woman confessed to hitting her daughter once with an ice skating rink, she was defended by a friend of Tonya’s (Sandra Luckow), who spoke in LaVonas defense and explained that the woman was not so bad. Sandra revealed that LaVona funded her daughter’s skating lessons and appreciated her hard work. All in all, she described LaVona as a woman with a large portion of humanity.</p><h2><strong>Spouse Or Husband, Is She Married?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Tonya-and-Joseph-Price.jpg><p>As for love, Harding has three marriages behind him. Her first marriage was to Jeff Gillooly, who earned his living in the sales department of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. Their wedding took place on March 18, 1990, when Jeff was 22 and Tonya was 19, but unfortunately, they did not last long as a couple and were divorced in August 1993 after three exciting years together. It is important to note that it was Jeff who planned and executed the crime against Tonya’s skating rival Nancy Kerrigan. The crime prevented Nancy from participating in the 1994 Winter Olympics and Jeff was thrown into prison when he was found guilty of breaking the athlete’s legs.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>John Wayne Children, Wife, Family, Height, Death, Bio, Was He Gay?</a></strong></p><p>Harding paid a fine of $100,000. She also did 500 hours of community service when she pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the crime against her rival. She was also forced to retire from the 1994 World Figure Skating Championships, gave up her membership in the United States Figure Skating Federation, and was also stripped of the U.S. championship title she won in 1994.</p><p>In 1995 she entered into marriage with her second husband Michael Smith. The union, which can best be described as a brief encounter, ended the following year (1996). Her third husband (Joseph Jens Price) came into the picture in 2010. The two met for the first time in a place called Timbers and were married soon after. They have lived happily together ever since, and their marriage is blessed with a son named Gordon.</p><h2><strong>Height</strong></h2><p>The ex-American figure skater, nicknamed Bad Girl by the fans, is not generously gifted in her size. She stands at a below-average height of 5 feet 1 inch, while her body weight is 62 kg. During her days in the boxing ring, she fought in the featherweight and lightweight classes. Fortunately for her, the sports she competed in did not pay much attention to the height.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwbC62JpkoZmimbavs4yboKhlnprBbsPOq6uhZaOlvLa%2FxGamq2WYqsCjrc2dZJqflWK1prXGoatmpZ%2Bptaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftonya-harding-bio-net-worth-spouse-or-husband-age-height-mother.html&text=Tonya%20Harding%20Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Spouse%20Or%20Husband%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Mother&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftonya-harding-bio-net-worth-spouse-or-husband-age-height-mother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftonya-harding-bio-net-worth-spouse-or-husband-age-height-mother.html&title=Tonya%20Harding%20Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Spouse%20Or%20Husband%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftonya-harding-bio-net-worth-spouse-or-husband-age-height-mother.html&title=Tonya%20Harding%20Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Spouse%20Or%20Husband%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftonya-harding-bio-net-worth-spouse-or-husband-age-height-mother.html&title=Tonya%20Harding%20Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Spouse%20Or%20Husband%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftonya-harding-bio-net-worth-spouse-or-husband-age-height-mother.html&description=Tonya%20Harding%20Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Spouse%20Or%20Husband%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./33-facts-about-the-movie-cold-comfort-farm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="33 Facts about the movie Cold Comfort Farm">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jw-anderson-bumper-bag.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Modern Icon: JW Anderson's Bumper bag">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
