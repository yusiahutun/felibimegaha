In Valerie Donzelli's , there is incest. In Todd Haynes' , starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, there is forbidden love. And then there are Paolo Sorrentino's , in which Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel ogle women, and the great enfant terrible Gaspar Noe's 3D sex film .</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even when there is no actual sex on the screen, there is always a great deal of intensely publicised sexiness at the festival. Long before reality TV and the Kardashians, the concept of Z-list celebs publicly cavorting in a state of undress was pioneered at Cannes with the semi-official tradition of "starlets" appearing in skimpy swimming costumes on the Croisette. In 1953, 18-year-old Brigitte Bardot posed in a bikini opposite Kirk Douglas. The next year, the now-forgotten actor Simone Silva went topless at Cannes opposite a bemused Robert Mitchum. In 1964, Jayne Mansfield also appeared in her swimming costume and did an unedifying dance called the monkey bird with her chihuahua. Each event triggered huge overexcitement among the jostling photographers, in an age when this kind of photo opportunity was not as strictly policed as it is today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But there was also a good deal of scandal up on the screen. In 1961, Luis Bunuel's won the Palme d'Or. The strong sexual content of the film, about a woman on the verge of becoming a nun visiting her reclusive uncle, astonished and outraged many at Cannes - and indeed the Catholic church. In 1962, the bow-tied audiences at the festival were similarly affronted by . Directed by Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi, was an explicit "freakumentary" using genuine (and sometimes less than genuine) archive footage showing weird sexual rituals from all over the world, including a rite of passage in Nepal in which Gurkhas dress in women's clothing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/05/22/cc0c2a8c701603bee3d2fec0d1d2ec7a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shockable though Cannes audiences have always been, the idea of being upset simply at sex became a bit passé, and the shocking films became increasingly about violence, from Michael Haneke's to Gaspar Noé's . But sex is always a hot ticket at the festival. Steven Soderbergh's , the Palme d'Or winner in 1989, will hardly seem shocking to modern audiences, but the idea of videoing oneself talking about sex was racy for its time.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">It is a perennial complaint that gay sexuality and gay relationships are under-represented at Cannes</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the 1990s, we saw Larry Clark's , a disturbing film about the sex lives of teenage New Yorkers that was widely condemned as exploitative and quasi-paedophile. A critic friend said the first press screening for was so packed and disorderly, he had the shirt ripped from his back in the melee outside. A year later, David Cronenberg unveiled his , a version of the J.G. Ballard novel about a sexualised fetish for car crashes. The film was probably the last great censorship/moral-panic case in Britain surrounding a sexually explicit film.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the new century, Cannes revealed itself to be diverted and overexcited by several explicit films that appeared in the market, though not in the official selection. One was (that is, Kiss Me, or, ambiguously, F*** Me), about two young women who go on a kind of Bonnie and Bonnie tour of sex and violence, from the writer-directors Coralie Trinh Thi and Virginie Despentes. In 2004, Michael Winterbottom's interesting and underrated was also in the market rather than the official selection, and generated a huge amount of interest for its (rather romantic) view of obsessive, consenting sex. Two years earlier Carlos Reygadas' , which showed in the Director's Fortnight, became a great talking point for showing a middle-aged man having sex with a very old woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/05/22/8b6713e631ee8c6da204c0b3de61c62a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vincent Gallo's was squawked and screeched at in 2003 for what was admittedly a self-important and self-indulgent display, culminating in Gallo copping a 10-minute blowjob from Chloe Sevigny. The scene was supposedly authentic, though undermined by on-set reports of a large and realistic-looking phallic prosthesis being used.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2015/05/22/fa7285075b6832ffa7969dba2742c265.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In more recent years, John Cameron Mitchell's , which played out of competition in 2006, provided a wacky panorama of pervitude, beginning with a shot of a man giving himself oral pleasure. It becomes a mosh pit of mass fornication in which someone murmurs: "Isn't it great? Like the '60s, but without the hope."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">French films about sex tended to be very gamey and very serious in a way that only French cinema can be. , in competition in 2013, was a film that swooned over the sexiness of a beautiful teenage girl who becomes involved in high-class prostitution: it was a romanticised view of bought sex. Ulrich Seidl's far more brutally candid tackled sex tourism in Kenya and was decidedly unsexy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is a perennial complaint that gay sexuality and gay relationships are under-represented at Cannes, and that the festival is a quite conservative and heterosexual institution. Perhaps it is, though Wong Kar-wai's much admired , which showed in 1997 and examined the love affair between two men played by Leslie Cheung Kwok-wing and Tony Leung Chiu-wai, is often cited as a great gay movie at Cannes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Queer Palm was founded in 2010 by journalist Franck Finance-Madureira to recognise lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-relevant films at the festival. The award has gone successively to Gregg Araki's , Oliver Hermanus' , Xavier Dolan's , Alain Guiraudie's and Matthew Warchus' . Of these, I think the best is . A thrilling and fascinating story about a murder in a gay cruising spot, it's intensely and passionately about sex in a way that straight films typically aren't.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/2015/05/22/ce07a6deda8daf9466ffd61768b70141.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Abdellatif Kechiche's Palme d'Or-winning , showing the love affair between two women, has a real claim to be the most sexually explicit film to have won the big prize at Cannes, although many commentators, gay and straight, dispute the idea that this is an example of gay or queer cinema - more an example of the straight world's perennial fascination with lesbians. But sexy it certainly is. And I think Nicole Kidman's masturbation scene in Lee Daniels' much-misunderstood Florida noir - in competition in 2012 - is funny and sexy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But for my money, the best sex film ever presented at Cannes was (Rascals and Romps). Shown in 2002, and released in Britain under the title , it anthologises a dozen sex films furtively made in France between 1905 and 1925 to be shown in brothels and at stag parties. A chapter in the secret history of sex and the belle epoque, it's bizarre and hilarious - and in Britain was awarded the notorious R18 certificate (stricter than 18 and requiring licensed club conditions), evidently on the grounds that it shows a woman dressed as a nun pleasuring herself with a Jack Russell terrier.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That was probably the supreme Cannes sex moment.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: A history of sex on the beach</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmnKeslafBorXNppynrF%2BWv7W1wqWcaGloZYN6fJBoqp6wXZa7pXnNrpuirKliv7a4xGaamqaemsBussilpGaelajBqsLApWSsm6Kasq95wKeb</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsex-and-nudity-rule-cannes-film-festival-screen-and.html&text=Sex%20and%20nudity%20rule%20at%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival%20-%20on%20screen%20and%20off&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsex-and-nudity-rule-cannes-film-festival-screen-and.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsex-and-nudity-rule-cannes-film-festival-screen-and.html&title=Sex%20and%20nudity%20rule%20at%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival%20-%20on%20screen%20and%20off" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsex-and-nudity-rule-cannes-film-festival-screen-and.html&title=Sex%20and%20nudity%20rule%20at%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival%20-%20on%20screen%20and%20off" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsex-and-nudity-rule-cannes-film-festival-screen-and.html&title=Sex%20and%20nudity%20rule%20at%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival%20-%20on%20screen%20and%20off" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsex-and-nudity-rule-cannes-film-festival-screen-and.html&description=Sex%20and%20nudity%20rule%20at%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival%20-%20on%20screen%20and%20off" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./soap-star-meg-bennett-dies-after-spending-final-months-being-selfless-devoted-until-the-end.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Soap star Meg Bennett dies after spending final months being selfless - 'Devoted until the end'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./julian-sands-wife-evgenia-citkowitz-kids-his-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Julian Sands Wife Evgenia Citkowitz: Kids, Family, Death">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
