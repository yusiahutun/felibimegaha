In this article learn all about Berry’s Sister Heidi Berry-Henderson and Halle's personal life.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Halle Berry</strong></a> is a well-known actress in the United States with a net worth of<strong> $90 million</strong>. The accomplished actress began her career as a model and competed in several beauty pageants, ultimately placing second runner-up in the Miss USA competition and sixth overall in the Miss World competition in 1986.</p><p>Berry's breakthrough film role was in the romantic comedy Boomerang. This led to roles in The Flintstones and Bulworth, as well as the television film Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award. During the 2000s, she was one of Hollywood's most successful and well-paid actresses. Her other notable performance is in the X-Men film series where she played the role of&nbsp;<strong>Storm</strong>.</p><h2><strong>Halle Berry's Sister, Heidi Berry-Henderson</strong></h2><p><strong>Heidi Berry-Henderson</strong> is famous for being the sister of Halle Berry. She was born on October 6, 1964, in Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.&nbsp;</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2022/11/14/heidi-berry-henderson-is-famous-for-being-the-sister-of-halle-berry--1668418819.png width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Heidi Berry-Henderson is famous for being the sister of Halle Berry. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Dicy Trends</span></strong><p>Because Berry-Henderson's mother is white and her father is of black ethnicity, she has a heritage that is both multi-ethnic and multi-racial. Her parents are <strong>Jerome Berry</strong> and <strong>Judith Berry.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In addition to her acclaimed sister Halle, it is worth noting that she is reported to share a half-sister, Renee Berry, through their father.</p><p>Since she is a non-celeb, it is not surprising Heidi Berry-Henderson is pretty private about her personal life. Unlike her famous sister Halle, she lives a quiet life and reportedly is married and living with her husband.</p><h2><strong>Heidi Berry-Henderson's Celebrity Sister Halle Berry Is Dating Her Boyfriend Van Hunt Since 2020</strong></h2><p>Halle Berry has been through three marriages that ended in divorce and one serious relationship, but she has now found the person she wants to spend the rest of her life with. During COVID-19, she began a relationship with the singer<strong> Van Hunt</strong>.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2022/11/14/halle-berry-is-dating-van-hunt--1668418881.png width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>Heidi Berry-Henderson's sister <span class=imageCaption>Halle Berry is dating her boyfriend Van Hunt.&nbsp;</span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Instagram</span></strong><p>Berry was revealing her new man, teasing him via social media; however, in August 2020, he eventually posted a snapshot of the two of them kissing. "kisses land lightly," Van wrote adorably in the caption of the photo. A few weeks later, Halle confirmed that the two were dating.</p><p>Van was Halle's date for several prominent red-carpet events in 2021, including the Academy Awards and the opening of the Academy Museum, even though the couple has mostly been hiding their relationship from the public eye.</p><p>After the X-Men actress uploaded a picture of herself at an altar with Van while they were on vacation in January 2022, rumors began to circulate that the two had gotten married during their trip. "Well...IT'S OFFICIAL!" she said in the caption of the photo that showed the two of them kissing inside the venue, which was located on the premises of their resort.</p><h2><strong>Halle Berry's Past Relationships And Boyfriends</strong></h2><h3><strong>David Justice</strong></h3><p>Halle Berry tied the knot with her husband,<strong> David Justice,</strong> in 1993 when she was 27 years old. Justice is a professional baseball player. David was a member of the New York Yankees, the Atlanta Braves, and the Cleveland Indians and a part of two championship teams.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2022/11/14/halle-berry-tied-the-knot-with-david-justice-in-1993-she-was-27-years-old--1668418932.png width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Halle Berry tied the knot with David Justice in 1993; she was 27 years old. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Instagram</span></strong><p>The lovebirds made their first public appearance as a couple on the cover of Ebony magazine not long after their wedding. However, the pair divorced in 1997 after being married for four years. Due to Halle's request for a restraining order at the time of their breakup, the public believed that David may have abused Halle somehow.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Eric Benet</strong></h3><p>In 1997, shortly after Halle Berry had been divorced for the first time, she met <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Eric Benet</strong></a>, who would eventually become her second husband. The duo got to know one another at the House of Blues in Los Angeles but did not immediately start dating one another.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2022/11/14/in-1997-shortly-after-halle-berry-had-been-divorced-for-the-first-time-she-met-eric-benet-who-would-eventually-become-her-second-husband--1668418994.png width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Halle Berry was married to Eric Benet. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Instagram</span></strong><p>The email was the medium through which the friendship grew, and Halle realized that she was in love through these exchanges. "I faced him and said, 'You know what? I'm not sure, but I think I love you,'" Berry admitted to People in 2002.</p><p>At the premiere of Halle's HBO film Introducing Dorothy Dandridge in 2000, Eric proposed to her, and the couple got married in 2001. After getting married, Halle adopted his daughter <strong>India</strong>, whose birth mother, <strong>Tami Benet,</strong> died when India was just 15 months old.</p><p>Halle and Eric's relationship was one of the most talked about at the Oscars in 2002, the year that she made history by becoming the first Black actress to win an Oscar for her performance in Monster's Ball. After two years, Berry filed for divorce. Their separation was finalized in 2005.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Gabriel Aubry</strong></h3><p>After meeting on the scene of a photoshoot in 2005, Halle Berry and the Canadian model<strong> Gabriel Aubry</strong> immediately hit it off and began dating. At first, Halle noticed him while on a bus coming from another campaign. Then, she ran into him just a few days later while working on a set.&nbsp;</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2022/11/14/after-meeting-on-the-scene-of-a-photoshoot-in-2005-halle-berry-and-the-canadian-model-gabriel-aubry-immediately-hit-it-off-and-began-dating--1668419110.png width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>After meeting on the scene of a photoshoot in 2005, Halle Berry and the Canadian model Gabriel Aubry immediately hit it off and began dating. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Instagram</span></strong><p>Berry gave birth to her first child with Gabriel, a daughter named <strong>Nahla</strong>, on March 16, 2008, despite the couple not getting married. The couple broke up in 2010, but they stated in a joint statement that they "remain friends and committed parents to their daughter."&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Olivier Martinez</strong></h3><p>Halle Berry was introduced to <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Olivier Martinez</strong></a>, a French actor, the same year she ended her relationship with Gabriel Aubry. In 2010, the two of them collaborated on the production of the film Dark Tide, which was shot in South Africa. On set, they were seen making out, and shortly after, in Paris, they were seen walking hand in hand and kissing.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2022/11/14/halle-berry-was-introduced-to-olivier-martinez-a-french-actor-the-same-year-she-ended-her-relationship-with-gabriel-aubry--1668419284.png width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Halle Berry was introduced to Olivier Martinez, a French actor, the same year she ended her relationship with Gabriel Aubry. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Instagram</span></strong><p>In the early months of 2013, Halle discovered she was pregnant with her second kid, <strong>Maceo</strong>, and she gave birth to him on October 5 of that same year. Halle and Olivier tied the knot on July 13, 2013, at the Chateau des Conde in Vallery, France.</p><p>Sadly, the romance did not last long after that, and just a few months later, in 2014, rumors began to circulate that there were problems in paradise. Halle was spotted for the first time without her wedding band in August 2015, which led to the couple filing for divorce in October of that year, citing "irreconcilable differences." The divorce was finalized in 2017, and both parties have shared custody of Maceo.</p><p><strong>Stay updated in <a href=# rel=noopener>Married Wiki</a> for more celebrity news and articles.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyiuMtmq6GdXZmyta3IpapmmZKkwrV5wJumrqxdna6tuMRmmZ6qoq56tHnSoqqtnaJitaa1w6Jkm52ip8ZutMSnm56qo6S7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fall-the-details-about-about-halle-berry-s-sister-heidi-berry-henderson.html&text=All%20the%20Details%20About%20About%20Halle%20Berry%27s%20Sister%20Heidi%20Berry-Henderson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-the-details-about-about-halle-berry-s-sister-heidi-berry-henderson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-the-details-about-about-halle-berry-s-sister-heidi-berry-henderson.html&title=All%20the%20Details%20About%20About%20Halle%20Berry%27s%20Sister%20Heidi%20Berry-Henderson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fall-the-details-about-about-halle-berry-s-sister-heidi-berry-henderson.html&title=All%20the%20Details%20About%20About%20Halle%20Berry%27s%20Sister%20Heidi%20Berry-Henderson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fall-the-details-about-about-halle-berry-s-sister-heidi-berry-henderson.html&title=All%20the%20Details%20About%20About%20Halle%20Berry%27s%20Sister%20Heidi%20Berry-Henderson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-the-details-about-about-halle-berry-s-sister-heidi-berry-henderson.html&description=All%20the%20Details%20About%20About%20Halle%20Berry%27s%20Sister%20Heidi%20Berry-Henderson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./leona-lewis-talks-her-role-in-cats-the-musical-and-shares-her-beauty-secrets.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Exclusive: Leona Lewis talks making her Broadway debut in Cats">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-idol-debuts-euphoria-creator-sam-levinson-returns-sexually-charged-series-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Idol makes its SHOCK debut: Lily-Rose Depp goes topless, stars in VERY explicit masturbation">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
