But although he has been to remote parts of the world in places like Alaska and Cambodia, it is right here in Florida where he says he most loves to explore.</p><p class=p3><span class=s4>“Florida is replete with incredible habitats found nowhere else on Earth, from coastal mangroves to the Everglades </span>to North America’s only coral reef,” says Corwin, 55. “It is our ultimate natural treasure.”</p><p class=p3>For the past few years, he has been spending a lot of time in Martin County, and now the TV personality is getting ready to become an even more permanent fixture in Florida. He and his wife, Natasha, are hoping to move here full-time in the not-too-distant future—and, he reveals, he is currently in pre-production on a new television series (tentatively titled<span class=s3><i> Journeys to the Southern Wild</i></span>) that will focus on the flora and fauna of Florida. “Historically, for a show like mine, Florida is low-hanging fruit,” says Corwin of the series, which he notes will air on a major network.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s4>Corwin grew up in the Boston area, the son of a police officer</span> and a nurse. The family lived in a triple-decker home in a city where there wasn’t much nature to be appreciated. He recalls the local beach was polluted at the time, and the only time he could revel in the outdoors was when he visited his grandparents in the more rural town of Middleborough, Massachusetts, where he would go for long walks in the woods. “I’d see snakes and all these wonderful critters, and that was my gateway to nature,” he says.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/06/Corwin-holds-a-Florida-pine-snake-outside-Hobe-Sound-Nature-Center.-Photo-by-Steven-Martine-1024x683.jpg><p class=p3>The family moved to the suburbs when Corwin was 8, and that’s when he says his passion for exploring the natural world grew stronger. He got involved with his local science center and started working in wildlife rehabilitation when he was in high school. It was then that he decided whatever career path <span class=s4>he eventually chose would no doubt involve working with nature </span>and animals. “I wanted to inspire people to have a better connection and experience with nature,” he says.</p><p class=p3><span class=s5>By the time he earned his master’s degree in wildlife and fisheries conservation from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Corwin was already active in conservation. In 1993, when he was just 23, he addressed the United Nations General Assembly about protecting the rainforests in Central and South America.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p3><span class=s5>“I first went to a tropical rainforest when I was 16 years old,” he recalls. “By the time I was 18, I was going regularly, and by my early twenties, I was working as a guide in Belize. Rainfor</span>ests are critical to our planet. They are the zenith of life, where you get such a high concentration of organisms in such a small space. Rainforests take up only 5 percent of the planet’s surface but contain 70 percent of all life.” <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>The following year, he worked on a <span class=s4>documentary television series sponsored by </span><span class=s3><i>National Geographic</i></span> <span class=s4>called </span><span class=s6><i>The JASON Project</i></span><span class=s4> with Bob Ballard, the oceanographer who discovered the wreck of the </span><span class=s6><i>Titanic</i></span><span class=s4>. And that’s all it took to ignite his future in television. Corwin’s engaging persona and encyclopedic knowledge of and passion for the natural world made him a mainstay on television, hosting a slew of nature shows and giving commentary about natural disasters like tsunamis on cable news.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/06/Corwin-with-a-barred-owl-at-Hobe-Sound-Nature-Center.-Photo-by-Steven-Martine-768x1024.jpg><p class=p3>The very first episode of Corwin’s first lead television series, <span class=s3><i>Going Wild with Jeff Corwin</i></span>, was filmed just south of Miami at Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station, covering its crocodile recovery program in 1997. Since then, he hasn’t stopped coming back to Florida. His <span class=s2>various shows have seen him protecting </span>manatees in the waterways of Central Florida, saving sea turtles on South Florida’s beaches, and electrofishing for snook in the Everglades.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>When he and his family began visiting a dear friend who moved to Martin County four years ago, they fell in love with the area. “It’s one of the last places in Florida where you can wander off the beaten path and feel like you’re in Old Florida,” says Corwin, adding that he’s an 8-mile-a-day hiker who revels in the “critters” he finds while ambling around places like Stuart’s Seabranch Preserve State Park. “I would love for a sign to be put up in Seabranch that tells cyclists to watch where they’re going because there’s such an amazing inventory of animals you can find there, like glass lizards and anoles.”</p><p class=p3>And yet, he says, the state’s natural wonders are still threatened by unbridled development. With 1,000 people moving to Florida every day—including Corwin, with his imminent move—he realizes that a time will come when he potentially becomes a part of that prob<span class=s2>lem. If development continues unabated, </span>he speculates that one-third to one-half of wild Florida could eventually be gone. There is, however, an opportunity for redemption among those who are willing to step up and protect what remains. “It’s far more economically achievable to protect what’s there instead of restoring what’s lost,” he says.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>The key, he believes, is to get people to appreciate what we have here. “You cannot protect what you do not love, and you will never love it if you don’t get to meet it,” he says. “I want to introduce people to nature so they will fall in love with it. Florida is a poster child for this challenge.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/06/Corwin-enjoys-working-with-local-orgs-like-the-Hobe-Sound-Nature-Center-where-he-joined-the-board-of-directors-in-April.-Here-he-holds-the-centers-resident-gopher-tortoise-1024x768.jpg><p class=p3>To that end, Corwin recently spoke with a national group of science and biology teachers who expressed concern about the challenges of exposing students in urban areas to nature. Corwin suggested that family trips to the Sunshine State were an affordable way to accomplish that. “Any part of Florida is accessible when it comes to having access to these monumental and fundamental building blocks in the natural world,” he says. “For a reasonable price, a kid and their family could come here and see all of this and paddle in a kayak surrounded by nature.”</p><p class=p3>For the time being, Corwin has been working with local groups to tackle heavy obstacles to protect Florida’s natural wonders, such as manatees and mangroves. In April, he joined the board of the Hobe Sound Nature Center at Nathaniel P. Reed National Wildlife Refuge, and he is an avid supporter of the Florida Oceanographic Society surrounding the work they do promoting and preserving this part of the state. He also serves as an advisor to the Loxa-Lucie Headwaters Initiative and <span class=s4>Guardians of Martin County, whose mission is to protect a 70,000-acre ecological </span>corridor that connects the sources of the Loxahatchee and St. Lucie Rivers and forms a preserve for native plants and wildlife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/06/Corwin-says-he-enjoys-discovering-various-critters-during-walks-in-Seabranch-Preserve-State-Park.-Photo-by-Steven-Martine-768x1024.jpg><p class=p3>“Sometimes I think we take Florida for granted and assume it’s always going to be there,” says Corwin. “Despite all the challenges the state faces, it’s home to incredible gems like the manatees and the ospreys.”</p><p class=p3>Corwin and his wife are planning a move here when the timing is right—specifically, they have their eyes on Hobe Sound, where Corwin appreciates that they can be surrounded by the natural gems that light up his eyes when he talks. Their daughters are growing up—the elder is a sophomore in college, while the younger is high school bound next year—and with Corwin’s new Florida-based nature show in the works, that time might just be very soon.</p><p class=p3>“We want to figure out how to make Martin County our next chapter,” he says. “Part of that will involve us working with the great ambassadors for the state to do what we can to keep it special.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p4><i>Keep up with Corwin’s adventures on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>.</i></p><h3 class=p1>Nature Fixes</h3><p class=p2><i>A few of Corwin’s favorite local spots and activities</i></p><p class=p4><span class=s1><b>Go for a walk: </b></span>Seabranch Preserve State Park</p><p class=p4><span class=s1><b>Have a picnic:</b></span> “The beach on the other side of Peck Lake.
