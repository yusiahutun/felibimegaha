Her wisdom and beauty awareness made her a cheerleader for her teams at school. She became a very successful model and earned a lot of money through a modeling career at the age of 17.</p><p>Her platinum blonde hair color is actually a bleached version, but she doesn’t regret it. She even owes it to her that she became a model until she bleached her (originally light brown) hair in an interview.</p><p>Some details from her biography are missing and are not officially disclosed. Like the names of her parents. No reliable data is publicly available for this.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Robin Vernon Married Life/Divorce</strong></h2><p>Robin Vernon is currently divorced after she was married to her long-time friend Ted Vernon, who is also an actor. The couple met under the most bizarre circumstances – blind date in 1998 – but the relationship developed into a strong bond and in no time they lived together.</p><p>But it took another two years (in 2000) until the couple finally officially married, and although everything looked smooth from the outside, the first indication that the relationship was heading for the rocks was the age difference between the power partners (about 30 years).</p><p>True to suspicion, in 2016, after many rumors about the status of their marriage were spread in various media, Ted and Robin Vernon decide to set the record directly on their relationship.</p><p>On November 14, Ted Vernon announced on Twitter that Robin Vernon had played her last role as an actress in the American TV series South Beach Classic, introducing marketing specialist and model Christine Morris as his new partner in the series.</p><p>This effectively confirmed the rumors about the divorce, meaning Robin Vernon was out for good. Robin, for her part, twittered about the divorce – a month later (December 13, 2016) and said that she had ended her marriage with Ted.</p><p>Even though the couple’s possible confirmation (of the divorce) came as unexpected, it was foreseen by the viewers. Several reasons were cited as the reason for the expectation (separation), including incidents of physical and verbal abuse between the couple. The very large age gap (over 30 years) is another reason.</p><p>Robin and Ted Vernon had a son together – Ted Vernon Jr.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Husband</strong></h2><p>Ted Vernon is Robin Vernon’s ex-husband. Born and raised on Long Island, New York, Ted is a famous TV personality known for his South Beach Classics show. He is of Jewish ethnicity, average size and known for his “Hulk Horgan” style mustache and muscular body. He is known as WolfMan.</p><p>Before establishing himself as an actor, Ted began his journey to fame as an amateur boxer in the 1920s.</p><p>Ted Vernon is a very dynamic personality and is known for a variety of interests. He is an auto tracer, producer, actor, ex-racer, ex-wrestler, ex-boxer, ex-singer and of course ex-man (of Robin).</p><p>He has appeared in films such as Scarecrows, where he played a leading role and also produced the horror film Angel of Dying.</p><p>Ted has also led his own rock and roll music band called Ted Vernon and the Bulldogs, The Chromatics and The Autotones as lead singer for years. He has made numerous music videos, including Miami High Boy with Don Johnson and Andrew Hugger and My Blue Angel with Aaron Tippin.</p><p>Ted was divorced before meeting and marrying Robin. He had two children (boys) from his previous marriage, although the ex-wife’s name remains unknown.</p><p>His net worth is estimated to be about $15 million.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jim Carrey Daughter, Wife, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Height, Wiki, Death</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Surgery</strong></h2><p>There is much speculation that Robin Vernon has changed her physique and face through plastic surgery. And although she has refused to talk about the subject in almost every interview, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim for surgery. So there remains another unsolved rumor about Robin Vernon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Social Media</strong></h2><p>Robin Vernon is very active in social media and especially on Twitter. Her Twitter account – @RobinVernon reveals rare details about her private life from time to time. A perfect example is the fact that her separation from her ex-husband Ted Vernon was confirmed by her on Twitter. She is also active on Facebook and Instagram, where she has many followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Robin Vernon Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Robin Vernon’s current net worth is estimated at around $2 million. Already as a teenager, she started to earn money by modeling. She also made a lot of money through professional acting. Vernon co-owned Ted Vernon Specialty Automobiles along with her ex-husband, Ted.</p><p>This joint venture company plays an important role in the numbers (net assets) it has accumulated over the years. There are also notes that also contribute significantly to the equation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Robin Vernon Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>Height: 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm)</p><p>Eyes Colour: Dark Brown</p><p>Weight: 55 kg or 121 lbs.</p><p>Ethnicity: White American</p><p>Hair Color: Platinum blonde</p><p>Bra Size: 34 B</p><p>Shoe Size: 10 US</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kv7CuyKdkr52io7yvecGipmavmaC2brnAq6minZRisarCzquanmWYmraotNNmrp6hl53BbrnEmqquqpWisq%2FA0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frobin-vernon-bio-wiki-married-divorce-height-weight-measurements.html&text=Robin%20Vernon%20Bio%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Married%2c%20Divorce%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Measurements&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frobin-vernon-bio-wiki-married-divorce-height-weight-measurements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frobin-vernon-bio-wiki-married-divorce-height-weight-measurements.html&title=Robin%20Vernon%20Bio%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Married%2c%20Divorce%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frobin-vernon-bio-wiki-married-divorce-height-weight-measurements.html&title=Robin%20Vernon%20Bio%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Married%2c%20Divorce%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frobin-vernon-bio-wiki-married-divorce-height-weight-measurements.html&title=Robin%20Vernon%20Bio%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Married%2c%20Divorce%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frobin-vernon-bio-wiki-married-divorce-height-weight-measurements.html&description=Robin%20Vernon%20Bio%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Married%2c%20Divorce%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Measurements" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./travis-barker-gushes-over-beautiful-girlfriend-rita-ora-2015110.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Travis Barker Gushes Over &amp;quot;Beautiful&amp;quot; Girlfriend Rita Ora">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jessica-simpson-naked-pregnant-baby-girl-eric-johnson-elle-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pregnant Jessica Simpson Goes Naked, Reveals Baby's Sex!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
