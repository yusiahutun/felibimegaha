The pair tied the knot in May 2018 but later relocated to <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>‘s native home of California in June 2020, expressing a desire for space to raise their son, Archie. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex welcome their daughter Lilibet in 2021, and the couple no longer holds <a href=#>official UK residency</a>. That said, Harry was refused in a myriad of ways by <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, especially during one visit to the UK before her passing in September 2022.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1054546696-1-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-queen-elizabeth-ii-was-disappointed-after-harry-and-meghan-s-oprah-interview>Queen Elizabeth II was ‘disappointed’ after Harry and Meghan’s Oprah interview</h2><p>In the wake of Harry and Meghan’s revealing <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> interview in March 2021, much fuss was made in the media over claims made by the pair about members of the Royal family. This extended to accusing an unnamed member of racist remarks.</p><p>In the months leading up to The Queen’s passing at 96, The Telegraph <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a> there was some disappointment and upset felt regarding Harry and Meghan’s behavior and public statements.</p><p>Firstly, she was reportedly disheartened about the Oprah interview, which took place during Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh’s hospitalization; he died in April 2021. Of course, it’s now widely known she herself was experiencing issues of <a href=#>health</a>.</p><p>An insider relayed to the publication: “It became clear that she was on borrowed time as she began to tie up loose ends. That’s what made the Sussexes’ behavior doubly difficult to deal with. The timing could not have been more insensitive.”</p><p>On the topic of the somewhat infamous interview, Queen Elizabeth II released a statement, addressing claims made by the Sussexes’ by saying “Some recollections may vary.”</p><p>It’s said by those close to her that she was both “devastated” and “disappointed” by the claims the pair made against the family. <a href=#>Prince William</a> also later told reporters they were ‘very much not a racist family’.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-queen-refused-harry-and-meghan-in-numerous-ways>The Queen refused Harry and Meghan in numerous ways</h2><p>In writer and journalist Tom Bower’s book Revenge: Mehan, Harry And The War Between The Windsors, it’s written that The Queen didn’t wish for Meghan to attend the Duke’s funeral, and Tom details the claim she told an aide “Thank goodness Meghan isn’t coming.”</p><p>The Sussexes were told no when it came to undertaking any royal engagement, and similarly, they were denied using their royal titles, the source adds. Additionally, Harry was told he couldn’t represent The Firm at military events.</p><p>But it doesn’t end there. The Queen also gave a firm ‘no’ when decreeing that Harry and Meghan were no longer to use their Sussex Royal branding.</p><p>Later on, when attending Platinum Jubilee celebrations three months before her passing, she said no when asked to take photos with the couple’s two children, <a href=#>Archie and Lilibet</a>.</p><p>It’s reported she refused on the grounds she had a bloodshot eye.</p><p>The Telegraph claims Harry was particularly “persistent” about the photo opportunity, clearly considering an official snap of them together of great importance. And yet, she refused.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2eDcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaumqtdqbytsIynpmaZlqmys3nBnqCnn12lsrO%2FyKyrnqakYsSqwMdmo5qslWK%2BtrHEp2SwoaSderG0zq2mZqqVpsKmv9No</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprince-harry-was-told-no-after-being-persistent-with-late-queen-with-photo-request.html&text=Prince%20Harry%20was%20told%20%27no%27%20after%20being%20%27persistent%27%20with%20late%20Queen%20with%20photo%20request&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-harry-was-told-no-after-being-persistent-with-late-queen-with-photo-request.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-was-told-no-after-being-persistent-with-late-queen-with-photo-request.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20was%20told%20%27no%27%20after%20being%20%27persistent%27%20with%20late%20Queen%20with%20photo%20request" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprince-harry-was-told-no-after-being-persistent-with-late-queen-with-photo-request.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20was%20told%20%27no%27%20after%20being%20%27persistent%27%20with%20late%20Queen%20with%20photo%20request" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-was-told-no-after-being-persistent-with-late-queen-with-photo-request.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20was%20told%20%27no%27%20after%20being%20%27persistent%27%20with%20late%20Queen%20with%20photo%20request" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-harry-was-told-no-after-being-persistent-with-late-queen-with-photo-request.html&description=Prince%20Harry%20was%20told%20%27no%27%20after%20being%20%27persistent%27%20with%20late%20Queen%20with%20photo%20request" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ron-santo-and-judy-lynn-scott.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ron Santo and Judy Lynn Scott">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./g-tec-group-of-institutions-leading-the-way.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="G-TEC Group of Institutions | Mehroof Manalody: Leading the Way in Computer Education">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
