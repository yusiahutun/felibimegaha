He later told police he heard a man screaming, ran downstairs and saw a man -- later identified by authorities as her ex, 42-year-old Ewen Dewitt -- standing over his mother with an axe in his hand "and blood all over."</p><p>The teen then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> ran upstairs, locked himself in his bedroom and called 9-1-1, before jumping out of his window in fear.</p><p>By the time police arrived, the suspect had already fled the scene. Court documents (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FOX61</a>) said an axe was found near the victim, while Minogue's 3-year-old son was also home at the time of the attack.</p><p>Ring footage from a neighbor -- via the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New Haven Register</a> -- shows a man carrying an axe in the area around the time of Minogue's murder. Police said the person in the video matched Dewitt's description.</p><p>The suspect's mother called police and said he called her, confessing to killing his girlfriend. After witnesses saw someone matching Dewitt's description, he was apprehended inside a food truck and taken into police custody.</p><p>Dewitt has been charged with Murder, Criminal Violation of a Standing Criminal Protective Order, Criminal Violation of a Restraining Order, Risk of Injury and Reckless Endangerment and is being held on $5 million bond.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ee1d500c-f9f6-46b4-a871-869508c16a44 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f1297a39-cb81-45f1-9ccb-912318a495d6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c6/5by4/2022/12/07/c62c279c87c0474a90991d799bf719e9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Indiana Murderer Inspired By Serial Killers Who Brutally Slayed Two Avoids Death Penalty</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Milford Police confirmed they previously arrested Dewitt in November 2019 for assaulting Minogue, who was issued a protective order at the time by the court. Police confirmed Minogue was then granted a full no contact restraining order against Dewitt just days prior to her murder, on December 1, after she said he was sending her "harassing text messages."</p><p>According to FOX61, her complaint read, "I don't feel I should be subjected to this abuse any longer. I am scared for the safety of my children and I. Ewen has got himself into a lot of trouble with drugs and alcohol, and I'm scared he's going to kill me."</p><p>During Dewitt's arraignment, Assistant State Attorney Alanna Paul claimed the man confessed to the crime.</p><p>"Even without that, I would argue that the case against the defendant is very strong. There is surveillance footage. There is a 17-year-old witness to part of this incident. It is a very serious case and I think it warrants a very serious bond," added prosecutors.</p><p>Dewitt's attorney reportedly requested bond to be set at only $500,000, noting "mental health concerns about his client, who he said is also a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps." He has been placed on suicide watch, with a hearing set for December 14.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2ab8e23c-d123-43f7-9596-f47fe11f5a29 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f1297a39-cb81-45f1-9ccb-912318a495d6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5e/5by4/2022/12/07/5e55a5ded57f4be3a4fefe6869461dbf_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Jeff Foltz/Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Florida Mother Dead After Gas Can 'Exploded in Her Hands', Injured 11-Year-Old Son</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGtmaXBfn8KttcRmpKKmn5zCpnnMrqmdnaJisrixzWabnq%2BZqcFw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjulie-minogue-murder-ewen-dewitt.html&text=Woman%20Murdered%20by%20Ex%20Days%20After%20Getting%20Restraining%20Order%20Claiming%20%27He%27s%20Going%20to%20Kill%20Me%2c%27%20Police%20S&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjulie-minogue-murder-ewen-dewitt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjulie-minogue-murder-ewen-dewitt.html&title=Woman%20Murdered%20by%20Ex%20Days%20After%20Getting%20Restraining%20Order%20Claiming%20%27He%27s%20Going%20to%20Kill%20Me%2c%27%20Police%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjulie-minogue-murder-ewen-dewitt.html&title=Woman%20Murdered%20by%20Ex%20Days%20After%20Getting%20Restraining%20Order%20Claiming%20%27He%27s%20Going%20to%20Kill%20Me%2c%27%20Police%20S" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjulie-minogue-murder-ewen-dewitt.html&title=Woman%20Murdered%20by%20Ex%20Days%20After%20Getting%20Restraining%20Order%20Claiming%20%27He%27s%20Going%20to%20Kill%20Me%2c%27%20Police%20S" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjulie-minogue-murder-ewen-dewitt.html&description=Woman%20Murdered%20by%20Ex%20Days%20After%20Getting%20Restraining%20Order%20Claiming%20%27He%27s%20Going%20to%20Kill%20Me%2c%27%20Police%20S" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./country-music-women-essential-albums-2010-and-on.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Essential Country Albums Released By Women Since 2010">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jan-bazyl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jan Bazyl dating?
