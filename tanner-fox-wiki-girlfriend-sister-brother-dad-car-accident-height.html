His channel offers challenging and inspiring videos and scooter stunts. Tanner’s favorite stunt, which he likes to perform, is the freestyle flair category. His love and dedication to his scooter stunts have contributed a lot to his successful career. Several of his videos have also featured his best friend Jake Angeles, who is just as passionate as he is about scooter riding.</p><p>Homeschooling has helped him to develop his scooter skills as it gives him more time to spend with his friends. Tanner is inspired by Dylan Morrison, the famous scooter rider who is known for his extraordinary and funny stunts on his vehicle.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Kim Marie Kessler Wiki, Kids, Biography, Married, Husband, Facts</a></strong></p><p>Tanner is also associated with particularly popular games like Root Industries, Lucky Scooters, and Grind shop and has made several video demos.

He later confirmed that he had a relationship with Taylor Alessia, with whom he went to Disneyland, and you could see them kissing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sister and Dad</strong></h2><p>Tanner has an older sister named Lindsay Fox.
