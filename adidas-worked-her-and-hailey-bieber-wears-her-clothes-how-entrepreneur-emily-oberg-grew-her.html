Dressing like the late <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Princess Diana</span></a> in an oversized sweatshirt and biker shorts has timeless and effortless appeal – even if on a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Zoom</span></a> meeting at home and not making time for a midday <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">PT session</span></a>, cold-pressed juice in hand.<figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I started the brand because I had a passion for a certain aesthetic and lifestyle. I didn’t start it because I wanted to become rich.Emily Oberg</figure>Looking back at the launch of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Instagram</span></a> page, Oberg says: “The story behind its name was basically just a way to describe my own style, and style that I loved at the time and still do. Mixing high with low, luxury with sport – everything that’s now ubiquitous and loved by many.”Sporty & Rich has over 150 stockists and is worn by the likes of models <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hailey Bieber</span></a> and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. But entrepreneurship wasn’t always the plan for Oberg, who grew up in Calgary, in Alberta, Canada, and was introduced to fashion by her aunts, one of whom was a buyer at clothing retailer Club Monaco.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Early on in her career, she worked in a number of fields in fashion and experimented with a variety of roles: she went from working in retail to joining New York-based Complex magazine as an on-camera personality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/24/adaa0356-9f2e-477e-b876-367bd764b239_2f2fbc2c.jpg>Years later, Oberg, who by this time had amassed a substantial social media following, took on the role of creative lead for streetwear brand Kith’s womenswear line. The year was 2017, and streetwear was having its big mainstream moment – remember <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Supreme and Louis Vuitton’s crimson crossover</span></a>? – but she was still after the perfect fit.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I felt a bit lost in my early 20s, and thought maybe I want to be the image director of a brand, maybe work in fashion media and journalism,” she says. “I really didn’t know and was still figuring out who I was and what I loved.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At Complex, Oberg realised she didn’t want to work in fashion media; at Kith, she became more invested in the prospect of starting her own brand. She stepped down in 2018 before pursuing Sporty & Rich as a full-time venture the following year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/24/fae25dc0-b11e-4fe1-a623-9dd2dc65cd37_9526ec1f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brand materialised as a print magazine to start. “I didn’t have an intention to turn it into a brand, because I felt the fashion space was so oversaturated,” Oberg says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though the print format brought her “great joy”, it proved unsustainable – she was barely breaking even.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Much has changed since. As well as selling her wares – which span retro-inspired activewear, loungewear and accessories – to a global network of wholesale partners, Oberg and her Paris-based team of 25 are focusing on growing direct-to-consumer sales.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I love clothes and style, but my true passion is wellness and I live my life around wellness and being healthy.Emily Oberg</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They’re also working on a number of collaborations, and are in the midst of launching new product categories like beauty. And Oberg hasn’t sworn off media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alongside its main offerings, Sporty & Rich regularly posts articles via its website and a wellness-dedicated Instagram account, exploring topics such as sleep deprivation tanks and the recent boom of antidiabetic medication turned weight-loss aid Ozempic; in 2022, it published its first book, a 240-page hardcover tome titled The Sporty and Rich Wellness Book: Volume I.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s clear that Oberg is building more than just a fashion label. Her goal? To conquer the global lifestyle and wellness space.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/24/a48a22d8-e24c-4111-b8b9-3fd97fc52ddf_d5c406e9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I love clothes and style, but my true passion is wellness and I live my life around wellness and being healthy,” she says, adding that she’d like to open a chain of luxury sports and health clubs dedicated to personalised health, wellness and leisure.</p>While it’s an undeniably lucrative industry, Oberg also has personal reasons for being obsessed with wellness: she has an <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">autoimmune disease</span></a> and has figured out her own routine over the years to avoid falling ill.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As someone whose work often intersects with the notoriously elitist wellness space – and with a brand name like Sporty & Rich – Oberg is no stranger to backlash and understands where it comes from.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/24/5f82ebad-023b-44f6-bfba-a4438dd894a3_d5c406e9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They don’t want to hear someone going on about all the expensive and unattainable things that others do to maintain their health when they can’t afford to do the same. But for me, I just like sharing what I’m doing in the hopes of educating people,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She adds that she makes a conscious effort to share accessible and inexpensive tips to balance out the brand’s luxury-centric messaging. “It doesn’t mean they need to do what I do, and I’m not telling them to do what I do.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it comes to gender equity in streetwear, much has changed since Oberg’s Complex days. “Things have changed a lot, even in the past three to four years. There is space for women and it gets bigger every day,” she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How the Nike vs Adidas rivalry has found a new battleground – high fashion</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But like any woman working in a male-dominated space, she knows the playing field is far from level.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There have been a few instances where my [male] peers in the industry have made sure certain opportunities get taken away from me,” she says. “It upsets me at first, but at the end of the day I know it’s because of their own insecurities, and that’s pretty sad.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clearly, Oberg is keeping her head in the game. When asked the biggest piece of advice she would give prospective entrepreneurs, she answers: “To have the right intentions.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/04/24/4adce4ee-f7d5-4b98-a899-4534d72b8fe3_ab0a281a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I started the brand because I had a passion for apparel and design and a certain aesthetic and lifestyle. I didn’t start it because I wanted to become rich, or well known, or any of those things,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I would say the best advice for anyone doing anything at all is to make sure you genuinely love and care about it. Otherwise, you’ll never be happy and that’s really the only goal in life. To be happy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtocWhpbXyisMidmKxlp6S%2FrLHDZp%2Beql2Wu6V5x5qgpZ2pYq%2BqscGeqWavlZa%2FtHnHnqlmm5ykwamx0mafqK9dmru1vsSpqZ6mlaq%2FbrHMoqOyZZ%2BXsrOzjKCpnq9dnbKz</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fadidas-worked-her-and-hailey-bieber-wears-her-clothes-how-entrepreneur-emily-oberg-grew-her.html&text=Adidas%20worked%20with%20her%20and%20Hailey%20Bieber%20wears%20her%20clothes%3a%20how%20entrepreneur%20Emily%20Oberg%20grew%20her%20In&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadidas-worked-her-and-hailey-bieber-wears-her-clothes-how-entrepreneur-emily-oberg-grew-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadidas-worked-her-and-hailey-bieber-wears-her-clothes-how-entrepreneur-emily-oberg-grew-her.html&title=Adidas%20worked%20with%20her%20and%20Hailey%20Bieber%20wears%20her%20clothes%3a%20how%20entrepreneur%20Emily%20Oberg%20grew%20her%20In" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fadidas-worked-her-and-hailey-bieber-wears-her-clothes-how-entrepreneur-emily-oberg-grew-her.html&title=Adidas%20worked%20with%20her%20and%20Hailey%20Bieber%20wears%20her%20clothes%3a%20how%20entrepreneur%20Emily%20Oberg%20grew%20her%20In" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fadidas-worked-her-and-hailey-bieber-wears-her-clothes-how-entrepreneur-emily-oberg-grew-her.html&title=Adidas%20worked%20with%20her%20and%20Hailey%20Bieber%20wears%20her%20clothes%3a%20how%20entrepreneur%20Emily%20Oberg%20grew%20her%20In" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadidas-worked-her-and-hailey-bieber-wears-her-clothes-how-entrepreneur-emily-oberg-grew-her.html&description=Adidas%20worked%20with%20her%20and%20Hailey%20Bieber%20wears%20her%20clothes%3a%20how%20entrepreneur%20Emily%20Oberg%20grew%20her%20In" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./5-seconds-summer-star-calum-hood-seen-exposing-viral-snapchat-clip-band-jet-la-vmas-appearance-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Calum Hood seen graphically exposing himself in video to fan">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./actor-to-portray-audie-murphy-at-german-american-heritage-center.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Actor to portray Audie Murphy at German American Heritage Center">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
