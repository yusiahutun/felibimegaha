Celebration of such festivals brings a change in our regular routine. Festivals add good memories to our lives. It’s a way to unite people and revive a sense of joy and harmony in society. Let’s talk about festival celebrations in detail.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Why people celebrate festivals:</h4><li>A Festival Celebration is an expressive way to enjoy our culture, religion, and history.</li><li>All festivals hold some value, reason, and meaning to them. Celebrating festivals works as a reminder of those values and meaning to the community from time to time.</li><li>It brings the community together. It’s a way to unite them and develop harmony among them by exchanging emotions and practicing rituals.</li><li>Festival celebrations create opportunities for fun, enjoyment, amusement, and recreation.</li><li>It brings a Sense of joy, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">happiness</a>, spiritual enlightenment, and quality time with loved ones.</li><li>People who stay alone also get the time to rest and be with family.</li><li>Festival celebrations give job opportunities to many people and give a boost to the economy of the nation as well.</li><li>Festival celebrations give faith in goodness or winning positivity over evil forces. It helps to re-correct once thought process and nature of thoughts.</li><li>People are conditioned with festivals since childhood so as the festival comes they experience a shift or change in their emotional state.</li><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Psychology Behind Festival Celebration</h4><p>Our part experience, storytelling, upbringing (exposure), environment (family), and community (social group) shape once psyche. Repeated exposure to this can create conditions for the human mind. Conditioning in simple words is the association between two or more than two behaviors which is based on learning because of getting certain types of reinforcement. As the child grows, he gets exposure to an event (festival), and people whom he trusts or is dependent upon provide some meaning to it based on their previous exposure and experience. Repeat exposure to this creates a psychological background for the child regarding that event. It is also found that the earlier the exposure, the larger impact it will have on the person’s psyche.</p><p>Hence, as the child gets exposed to certain beliefs, rituals, and values in the early stages of life, he gets conditioned to it as he gets reinforced by his surroundings. For example, one child says Namaste and another says Sat Sri Akal both behavior has occurred because of the conditioning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.psychologs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Psychology-Behind-Festival-Celebration-2.jpg><p>As Children witness certain behaviors on a certain day, they learn behaviors. With age, they can change their beliefs and behavior because of any new exposure or thoughts as they grow. This is how a person develops his opinion, behavior, and emotions regarding festivals.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Festival celebration as a stressor</h4><p>Yes, for some people festival can be a stressor because:</p><li>Sometimes they have to behave or participate in activities which they don’t like to do.</li><li>Most of the time festival celebration increases the family’s financial expenses. People who are struggling to meet their daily needs difficulty can find it difficult to spend some extra amount on new clothes, whitewashing, or decorations to keep the family’s expectations.</li><li>Festival celebrations come with holidays. Working people have to complete their work before the holidays. Also, people, whose work is related to celebration-related materials (decorative items, clothes, eatables like cake, cookies, and chocolate) have to work very hard till the day of the festival.</li><p>People who are working for online shopping companies have to do tons of delivery before festivals which leads to an excessive workload on them in comparison to regular days.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Research study</h4><p>A study by the American Psychological Association (APA) found that “Stress around the holidays is disproportionately felt by women”. Women are more likely to feel that stress increases around the holidays. 44 percent of women report an increase in Stress during holidays in comparison to men, who reported 31 percent. Women reported they get less time for relaxation during holidays as they have an extra household workload of cleaning, cooking, and shopping.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Festival Celebration and Social Media</h4><p>During festival seasons and holiday’s people social media accounts are full of good vibes and beautiful pics.

In this state, people can feel left out as they can’t be part of exciting events and celebrations.</p><p>Also, people with poor self-image can feel less confident during or after the celebration as what they can see is too much of beautiful pics everywhere on social media. Holiday and festival celebrations are about switching off your social media and meeting people in person. Meeting your loved one in person makes you feel even better.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Festivals Celebration and individual difference</h4><p>People are different and that’s the beauty of this universe.
