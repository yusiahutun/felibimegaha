He is the recipient of the gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in the 1500 meters event and has received various record-breaking scores, setting the new Olympic and European record. Jakob holds the title of the youngest athlete and runs the one-mile distance in less than 4 minutes.

Jakob began his schooling life at a private school in Sandnes and spent his whole life there receiving education. Jakob’s father’s name is Gjert and shared his childhood with his two siblings- two brothers named Henrik, and Filip. Both of his brothers are older than him and both are middle-distance runners who compete internationally. All the brothers received their training from their father. The Ingebrigtsen family also has four other children: Kristoffer, Martin, Ingrid, and William. After the popularity of Jakob and his career, the family earned celebrity status and also became part of a TV series, Team Ingebrigtsen.</p><h3>Jakob Ingebrigtsen Career</h3><p>Jakob appeared in the Norwegian Championship 2015. He has also competed in the Norwegian Youth Championships 2015 in Norway in which he got 1st position in 800m and 2000m events. At the age of 15 years, he competed at the IAAF World U20 Championships 2016. He received his first international championship and remained in the highlights for the regular three seasons of his senior years, but he finished a respectable ninth in the 1500m final. On 27 May 2017, Ingebrigtsen became the youngest athlete in history to run the one-mile distance in less than 4 minutes, where he finished while being in 11th place in a Diamond League race at Hayward Field in Eugene, US.</p><p>While appearing for Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway with a time of 3:56.29, he ran almost two seconds faster on 15 June. On 8 July 2017, Jakob appeared for the first time in the 3000m steeplechase event where he beat the junior European record in Kortrijk, Belgium, and completed the race with the best timings- 8:26.81. On 26 May 2018, when he was just 17, Ingebrigtsen ran a 3:52.28 mile in the Prefontaine Classic’s Bowerman Mile and finished in 4th place. It was the fastest mile run by a 17-year-old.</p><h4>Rise to Fame</h4><p>On 5 July 2019, Jakob set a new personal best after he appeared for the U20 European Record in the 1500m, where he ran with timings of 3:30.16 in Lausanne. On 20 July, he set a new National Record when he appeared and ran for the U20 European Record at 5000m (13:02.03 in London). As of 6 October 2019, Jakob was ranked as the second best 1500m runner in the world, only behind Timothy Cheruiyot. Making his debut at the distance, he broke Sondre Nordstad Moen’s Norwegian 10 km record at the Hytteplanmila in Hole on 19 October 2019, with victory at 27:54.</p><p>During the time of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics [which was delayed because of the pandemic], Ingebrigtsen set an Olympic and European record at 3 minutes 28.32 seconds and secured a gold in the 1,500-meter final, after eclipsing the previous record of 3:31:65 held by the Kenyan Abel Kipsang. After holding the record, Jakob became the second youngest winner of the event. On the final bend, Ingebrigtsen overtook for the first time Timothy Cheruiyot, who won the silver medal.</p><p>On 10 June 2021 at the Diamond League in Florence, Italy, Jakob set a new European record in the 5000 m with his time of 12:48.45, in a race where a half-dozen competitors bested a time of 12:55. Ingebrigtsen set his first senior world record, clocking 3 minutes 30.60 seconds for the indoor 1500m on 17th February 2022 and broke Samuel Tefera’s 3-year-old record by 0.44 seconds. At the 2022 World Indoor Championships in Belgrade, Jakob Ingebrigtsen was beaten in the event by Tefera with 3:32.77, CR, however, he still worked hard and received second place with the special timing record of 3:33.02.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Jakob Ingebrigtsen Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Jakob Ingebrigtsen</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>19 September 2000</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2022)</td><td>21 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Sandnes, Norway</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Athlete</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 1” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 186 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 80 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 176 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jakob-Ingebrigtsen-2.jpg alt width=960 height=721 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Gjert Arne Ingebrigtsen</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Tone Ingebrigtsen</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>Ingrid Ingebrigtsen</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>Filip Ingebrigtsen,&nbsp;Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Martin Ingebrigtsen, Kristoffer Ingebrigtsen, William Ingebrigtsen</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>In Relation</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Girlfriend</td><td>Elisabeth Asserson</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Jakob Ingebrigtsen is a famous and richest runner.
