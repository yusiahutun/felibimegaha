Conversely, guitarists have also harnessed the skill and entertained music listeners in different capacities.</p><p class=align-left>Often, they are in the background, hardly in the limelight, but some are so good that they have broken the barrier to become fan favourites.

It hardly happens in Kenya, but things change. The most iconic guitarists give fans life-changing experiences as they satiate their appetite for good tunes from the old-school instrument that has existed for thousands of years. But who counts as the best guitarist in Kenya?</p><p class=align-left>Considering the country's diverse music genres, there have been mixed reactions towards guitarists; some are considered the best in their respective fronts and wouldn’t even be considered in others. However, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according to People Daily</a>, these are the best guitarists in Kenya.</p><h3>1. Polycarp Otieno</h3><p class=align-left>It is only recently that fans have heard Polycarp Otieno sing. He has been part of Sauti Sol since the band's formation, but fans hardly listened to his voice except for interviews. Like many people, you have probably wondered what kept him in the award-winning group.</p><p class=align-left>He is an immensely talented guitarist. Polycarp’s exceptional guitar skills have earned him the name Fancy Fingers, a moniker he uses often. Over the years, the guitarist has grown from being Sauti Sol’s exclusive guitarist to playing other <a href=#>music blends</a>, including rhumba, blues-rock, and much more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/97f290d21bc5762c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sheeran copyright battle could stoke songwriting paranoia</span></p></a><h3>2.
