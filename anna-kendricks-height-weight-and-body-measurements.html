Whether it’s her character in the Twilight saga or Beca from Pitch Perfect, we love Anna. So, before we start on the subject of Anna Kendrick’s height, weight and body measurements let’s check some fresh facts about the actress herself.</b></p><p>She was born Anna Cooke Kendrick on August 9, 1985, in Portland Maine to Janice Cooke and William K. Kendrick. Her mother is an accountant and her father is a history teacher and they did not hesitate to support Anna’s dreams and nurture her talent. When she was younger, her parents often drove her to New York for auditions and it finally paid off when she was 10 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anna-Kendrick-1.jpg><p>She has been in the game for some time now and was even nominated for a Tony Award for her turn in high society at the age of 12. This makes her the third youngest person to be nominated. The first time she honored our television screens was in 2003 in the film Camp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/anna-kendrick-into-the-woods.jpg><p>During the Kennedy Center Honors in 2013, Anna managed to meet former United States President Barack Obama to fits of laughter. The actress described this moment as “the coolest three seconds of my life” and to this day no one really knows what she said… Except maybe Michelle.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ:&nbsp;<a href=#>Zuleikha Robinson Bio, Wiki, Married, Husband, Kids, Family</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Anna-kendricks.jpg><p>She has a somewhat spontaneous side with her, Anna with her actress partner and at one point, co-star Aubrey Plaza she went on a spontaneous trip to Mexico. Although the details of the trip were not mentioned (like what is happening anywhere remains a secret for those outside this place) they shared that at one point Aubrey spilled coffee all over her. Her Twitter feed is both hilarious and entertaining, so follow @AnnaKendrick47 for a laugh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/anna-kendrick-1.jpg><p>It is quite alarming that despite all her hard work since childhood and the industry’s recognition she remained relatively unknown until she starred in the movie Pitch Perfect in 2012. After meeting on the 2009 production of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Anna went out with director Edgar Wright. It’s funny no one really knew until three years later when they broke up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/anna-kendrick.jpg><p>As wonderful as it would be to keep going on and on… and on and on the time has come for us to focus on the subject on the agenda starting with Anna Kendrick’s Height.</p><h2><strong>Anna Kendrick’s Height</strong></h2><p>She has officially arrived on our list of little actresses in Hollywood, you don’t need a tape measure to show you that the star is more inclined towards the shortest side of the height spectrum.
