Her father was of Polish ethnicity, and her mother hailed from Germany, England, and Ireland.</p><p>Her mother Millie was a professional opera singer who implanted in her a love of music at a young age. They moved to Lindenhurst, New York, where she became interested in theatre and began taking vocal lessons.</p><p>She sang her first solo at Daniel Street Elementary School at the age of eight, a song called <strong>“It Must Be Spring.”</strong> She participated in musical theatre at Lindenhurst Senior High School, playing Queen Guinevere in the school production of Camelot, and marching in the homecoming parade.</p><p>She also sang at the annual Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony. She had trained as a coloratura and planned to study at the Juilliard School, but she changed her mind and instead chose to study health education at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.</p><p>She left college at 19 to marry her first husband, high school sweetheart, and U.S. Army draftee Dennis Benatar. They moved to Virginia where Dennis was <strong>stationed as a soldier</strong> and she worked as a bank teller.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career_Beginnings></span><strong>Career Beginnings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Benatar didn’t like her new life as a housewife and bank teller.

The band soon <strong>gained popularity with Benatar</strong> at the lead which encouraged her desire to become a performer.</p><p>Benatar, now divorced, eventually returned to New York. She played at the clubs of New York and performed classic tunes she thought her fans wanted to hear. She had natural music skills and after a performance at the Manhattan, club <strong>Catch a Rising Star</strong>.</p><p>Pat Benatar attracted the interest of a Chrysalis Records producer who quickly signed her to a record deal. But, Benatar was nervous and not sure about her future plans. Everything changed when Benatar met Neil Giraldo, whose skills provided her with the perfect tone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Breakthrough></span><strong>Breakthrough</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1979, Benatar released her debut album <strong>“In the Heat of the Night”</strong> with Giraldo’s assistance.

Her popularity as a 1980s icon did not transfer well into the 1990s.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><p>While Benatar continued to make music, including albums like Gravity’s Rainbow (1993) and Innamorata (1997), she struggled to equal her prior success. In 2003, <strong>Benatar released an album “Go” </strong>which has recently tapped into the nostalgia surrounding the 1980s.</p><p>She continued to perform live and in 2009, she embarked on a tour with another trailblazing female rock musician, Debbie Harry. After that, she and Giraldo performed frequently, including a 35th Anniversary tour that began in 2014.</p><p>She was honored with a 2015 live CD/DVD release, 35th Anniversary Tour.
