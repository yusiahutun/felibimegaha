There was the hair sticking to your lips, the kiss mark left on every cup, and the need for constant reapplication. It’s a new era now, and we went on a hunt to find the best lip glosses that surpassed these stereotypes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And boy, did we find them! We discovered glosses so light we could barely feel them on, and glosses so luscious they made everyone’s head turn. Then we checked for any kind of stickiness by letting the fan whisper hair into our faces. We ate a hearty meal and noted if we needed touch-ups, and we timed how long it would take until the gloss simply faded. After a day of sporting perfectly painted pouts, we scaled down our initial list of 20 to present you these winning lip glosses.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-westman-atelier-squeaky-clean-liquid-lip-hydrating-lip-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Westman Atelier Squeaky Clean Lip Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Westman Atelier Squeaky Clean Liquid Lip Hydrating Lip Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YUVrU_3VQFCutVJvoyXbemEAG9A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Westman-Atelier-Squeaky-Clean-Lip-Balm-e75c337243f14fba9ff74ac63ad62ecb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In order for a lip gloss to win our “Best Overall” title, it needed to do more than just look good. When we observed how the product smoothly glided over our lips, didn’t cause a sticky sensation, and remained perfectly intact for 30 minutes, our interests started to peak. The luscious berry shade definitely swayed us to fall in love with this product — even more so when the color remained put through drinking and eating. But it was really its ability to not cause any tacky feelings, hold onto food particles, or collect in the corners of our mouths that really impressed us. We were able to go about our day without needing to check our mirrors or reapply every half hour — the lip gloss had an inspiring ability to go unfazed through the hours.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Was it moisturizing? Did it hydrate and heal? Does it taste good? Not necessarily. While it was certainly not drying, it did not serve any additional purpose other than create a colorful shine. While we personally love a scented lip gloss, those sensitive to perfumes might actually be happy to have it be tasteless. Not to mention, you’re spared from licking the balm off of your lips this way.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Almond oil,<strong> </strong>jojoba oil, shea butter, seed oil <strong>| Shades: </strong>6<strong> | Scented: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-nyx-professional-makeup-butter-gloss-non-sticky-lip-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYX Professional Makeup Butter Gloss Non-Sticky Lip Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NYX Professional Makeup Butter Gloss Non-Sticky Lip Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rO9exDr3X6tSLaGld0ZuID64xzk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nyx-butter-gloss-6bcb3d2a7d5446099daab729ddcd2917.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>NYX</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">NYX didn’t become one of the leading makeup brands over the decades for no reason. The budget-friendly beauty brand delivers lasting formulas with beautiful colors, and this butter gloss is just another one of those examples.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To begin, we loved the sheer amount of color options to choose from. The opulent color was easy to layer, and while it did transfer to any cup we drank water out of, it still looked perfectly intact on our lips. The creamy gloss was easy to glide over as well, coming out with the perfect amount and being neither too thick nor too thin. While on, it didn’t feel heavy or hindering, but a quick wind test proved that hair did stick to the lips. It didn’t get gooped in product or feel gross, however, so we count that as a win. For at least 20 minutes, the gloss didn’t evaporate or get absorbed, looking as good as new.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for whether it was moisturizing or not, we would say it did an excellent job of locking in existing moisture. We recommend applying a quick base layer of chapstick if you have dry lips, as it doesn’t necessarily add hydration on its own.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Beeswax, rice bran wax<strong> | Shades: </strong>29<strong> | Scented: </strong>Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-lips-tower-28-shineon-lip-jelly-non-sticky-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Sensitive Lips</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tower 28 ShineOn Lip Jelly Non-Sticky Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tower 28 ShineOn Lip Jelly Non-Sticky Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KOcWhuM1m_ygYQdHzb6Y87IHMJQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tower-28-shineon-lip-jelly-non-sticky-gloss-b35882ea651f46948fd12c1577407c07.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tower 28</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of delivering a beautiful shine and color, this lip gloss helped to hydrate and soften our lips. The Lip Jelly, as Tower 28 calls it, is meant to be a combination of a gloss and a balm, and we found the thick formula to glide on lusciously without feeling too heavy or too much. While it was on, we were surprised to notice a cooling and calming sensation. It didn’t tingle or feel tacky, just refreshing. Even when the gloss was wiped off, we were delighted to find our lips had actually softened.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We have to say, though, that it does not live up to its “non-sticky” name. We definitely struggled with the occasional hair strand getting stuck on our lips. That being said, it dried down without losing color, even through eating and drinking. We didn’t feel the need to reapply after a meal, which was a delightful bonus. As a matter of fact, we only reapplied twice a day for an all-day glossy look.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Apricot kernel oil, avocado oil, raspberry seed oil, rosehip oil, castor oil <strong>| Shades: </strong>13<strong> | Scented: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-mac-squirt-plumping-gloss-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hydrating</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mac Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MAC Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/L8EIZCVax9orv1ZvuSKFIaWV-ds=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mac-squirt-plumping-gloss-stick-367c28b9319c42818c682fad4d5c7908.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>MAC</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found this to be the best two-in-one lip gloss, thanks to its extraordinary hydrating capabilities and super shine. To begin, let us just say that a lot of gloss comes out at once. Without a mirror, we would easily make a mess. Conversely, it only takes a little to create an impactful shine, so the stick itself should last you a while.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once on, we noticed a slight tingling sensation caused by the minty flavor, which was the menthol helping to soothe and cool our lips. We also noticed it immediately pumping hydration in, giving our chapped lips some much needed relief. We deemed it the ideal product for year-round usage when different environmental factors come for the moisture in our lips. Despite its impressive damping capabilities, it still felt lightweight and easy to keep on. Even through meals and drinks, the gloss didn’t feel like it was getting in the way or in need of constant reapplication. Although it was slightly sticky the first ten minutes, once the moisture was locked in all that remained was a nice shimmer and some subtle color.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Menthol crystals, ginger root oil, coconut oil, shea butter, avocado oil<strong> | Shades: </strong>10 <strong>| Scented: </strong>Yes</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-7 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person applies MAC Squirt Plumping Gloss to their hand" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/a5yp6cDi58pU2PNqxvLEzUSN5_A=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-detail-mac-squirt-plumping-gloss-sticks-jjuliao-0391-d8247f41271647baa814ee9abb4267e9.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="Several different colors of MAC Squirt Plumping Gloss" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4AOvL7eai7ua9aJ_H5yAHLR1HwE=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-product-mac-squirt-plumping-gloss-sticks-jjuliao-0202-6bc036a0c07e4df49d21d135a3ddfbbd.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-non-sticky-tarte-maracuja-juicy-lip-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Non-Sticky</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tarte Juicy Lip Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0_zPEn81T_Kq5Lt9SBzzq9QdU08=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tarte-Maracuja-Juicy-Lip-Balm-98982ef1ef7d4101a345d784a1002ecd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Consider this the product for enhancing your natural lips to look subtly flirty and healthy. The gloss is neither too thick nor too sticky, and instead delivers just the right amount of product for a little shine. It’s pigmented, but only enough to make the natural color of your lips pop. And if we wanted to make it more noticeable, it was easy to build on by adding an extra layer or two.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When the wind blew in our faces, some strands of hair did get caught in the luscious trap of our lips. However, it was easy to remove and neither gooped or left any residue in our hair. We also loved the sensation of having this on — it was smooth and hydrating, not unlike a lip balm with extra wetness. We could see ourselves replacing our chapsticks and opting for this piece altogether. Even after 20 minutes of wear, the color and coverage felt great, making it past any eating and drinking. That being said, we did see some of the color transfer onto our cup, but a look in the mirror didn’t give away any changes in appearance.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Maracuja oil, grapeseed oil, goji, acai, vitamin E<strong> | Shades: </strong>12<strong> | Scented: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-lips-glow-recipe-plum-plump-hyaluronic-acid-lip-gloss-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry Lips</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Gloss Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Acid Lip Gloss Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qdsePtMjAxR5cRlOrqzez8y81Yw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/glow-recipe-plum-plump-hyaluronic-acid-lip-gloss-balm-3c881a201081478fa927e389a32f70ca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We are heading into balm territory with this Plum Plump Hyaluronic Acid Lip Gloss, so for those of you looking for a deeply hydrating product with a little shine, this is it. The gloss felt absolutely great on: silky, smooth, and far from tacky. As a matter of fact, almost no hair got stuck during our fan test, which was surprising considering that it’s not particularly lightweight. There’s some heft to the formula but in a pleasant way. Not only does it pump and lock in moisture into the lips, but it makes it easier to grab the balm out of the little capsule.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our lips are notoriously dry, but this helped make them more supple while creating a beautiful natural shiny finish. Yes, the gloss fades slightly after 20 minutes, but the balm and the moisturizing capabilities still feel very much present. Since there is no color to it, it simply creates a natural, nonliquid look that doesn’t bleed or transfer. Overall, we found this to be the perfect product for a natural shine and hydration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hyaluronic acid, kakadu plum blend, raspberry extract<strong> | Shades: </strong>1<strong> | Scented: </strong>No</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-13 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A jar of Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Acid Lip Gloss Balm out of the box" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7y7UAcgMfsvkNK2L6SOYON6GYus=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-product-glow-recipe-plum-plump-hyaluronic-acid-lip-gloss-balm-jjuliao-0144-30f8ed2548424c73a9346939cbbbb78a.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person applies Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Acid Lip Gloss Balm to their hand" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YF2FJ6G3bMOGyuoQw4eHA_g5XwY=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-detail-glow-recipe-plum-plump-hyaluronic-acid-lip-gloss-balm-jjuliao-0372-e18150cf6d964edeae9282010e7313c0.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dark-skin-tones-fenty-beauty-gloss-bomb-cream-color-drip-lip-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dark Skin Tones</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Cream Color Drip Lip Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Cream Color Drip Lip Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/125fv0GmivJC95Jm41lN8JILrl0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fenty-beauty-by-rihanna-gloss-bomb-cream-93fc5458c8224789bd89d31cae54daef.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Fenty Gloss Bomb surprised us, as we were expecting a more sticky gloss and instead received a hydrating cream that didn’t feel goopy or oily. The lack of a greasy feel made it a delight for daytime use, especially when combined with the little pop of natural color.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the tube, the gloss almost looked matted, but it glided on in a delicious (and we mean that literally, the cherry flavor was to die for) gloss finish. And although the shine dulled down after ten minutes, the color held up nicely. Instead of going into lipstick territory or in-your-face shine, this created a natural, semi-hydrating sheen fit for everyday use. While it helps to add in some moisture, it’s definitely not its leading purpose, so we wouldn’t replace our chapstick with this product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Shea butter, sunflower seed oil<strong> | Shades: </strong>5<strong> | Scented: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dermatologist-tested-rare-beauty-stay-vulnerable-glossy-lip-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Dermatologist-Tested</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rare Beauty Stay Vulnerable Glossy Lip Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez Stay Vulnerable Glossy Lip Balm in Nearly Berry" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/181o7xywcxyHcnaeQWIhzBqza_U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-stay-vulnerable-glossy-lip-balm--25e6d2aa81a04c2cb861942e53e7b911.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Selena Gomez’s beauty brand Rare Beauty got the stamp of approval from dermatologists, meaning that they are safe for all skin types, including sensitive ones.

It didn’t goop or weigh down on our lips, glossing over in a silky manner. It’s neither hydrating nor drying, so it’s definitely more for the looks than any kind of function — but oh boy, does it truly look stunning. A single layer already reveals the flirty and rosy hue, and adding on a second or third layer only made it pop more. It did so without overwhelming the lips with gloss, maintaining its lightweight nature. During the entire duration of wear, it never tingled or caused any irritation, making it a pleasant experience visually and physically.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Lotus, gardenia, white water lily<strong> | Shades: </strong>5<strong> | Scented: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-lasting-bobbi-brown-crushed-oil-infused-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long-Lasting</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bobbi Brown Crushed Oil-Infused Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bobbi Brown Crushed Oil-Infused Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xZnWnLOXhmcjNFgj3-TS97MgnBs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bobbi-brown-crushed-oil-infused-gloss-45634392b9334066a0546b3521dd9999.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bobbi Brown&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It’s not that shiny.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You know what we don’t have time for? Constant gloss reapplication. Luckily you won’t have to do so with this Bobbi Brown gloss. Aside from the fact that this gloss remained put for the duration of our test, it also felt comfortable the entire time. The creamy, condensed milk-like consistency made for a natural and hydrating sensation. Because of its lightweight nature, it didn’t feel greasy or sticky either. Nor did it settle into creases or bleed around the edges.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Snacks passed our lips without leaving crumbs, and unless we ate a full meal (smacking lips, napkins, and all) we really didn’t need to reapply the gloss. When the gloss finally did leave our mouths, it revealed a hydrated surface that felt plump and refreshed. This lip gloss gets bonus points for its delicious sweet orange starburst scent, which was a true delight to apply each time. What it didn’t have, however, was that classic shiny look that’s so synonymous with lip glosses.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Coffee seed oil, olive oil<strong> | Shades: </strong>9<strong> | Scented: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-color-payoff-jones-road-beauty-cool-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Color Payoff</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jones Road Beauty Cool Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jones Road Beauty Cool Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Fozfdt9oEb320_8IcABUMvFFN-g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jones-road-beauty-cool-gloss-6b1797759a2b4d17ae8ecdfeabb3cab3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jones Road Beauty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tried a plethora of Jones Road products</a> in the past, but their lip products outshone them all — this Cool Gloss fits right in with their killer lip line. More than just gloss, these tinted formulas offer a very opaque color to the lips, which simply looks stunning. The more layers we added, the more vibrant it became, without ever feeling too thick or heavy. The color also lasted the duration of the day, which was impressive.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Formulated with a bit of peppermint, the lip gloss awakens and plumps the lips with a smooth and cool feel. We loved that there was minimal stickiness — just enough to remain firmly put on our lips. Shine and hydration were present, but not overpowering, so it could focus much more on the beautiful color. Did we need to reapply when it transferred onto cups and foods? Yes, but the delicious minty taste felt like a nice post-desert treat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Shea butter, peppermint<strong> | Shades: </strong>10<strong> | Scented: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-shine-pat-mcgrath-labs-lust-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High Shine</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pat McGrath Labs Lust Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pat McGrath LUST Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LiPPwRhTkKic3IjM4wtQca_U5N8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pat-mcgrath-labs-lust-gloss-2eee4976531b4a2e9655f4cadf2408ca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for something for a night out?

All it took was one swipe to the top and bottom lips, and they were dosed with a luscious shine. While it is quite thick, it spreads evenly and smoothly and without gump. The hue of the gloss and overall shine is very noticeable, so while it’s not something you’d wear to the office, it’s certainly a head-turner for a night out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not happy with how vibrant the first impression is, just wait 20 minutes as it settles into the skin and calms its striking color. Either that or gently pat down with a tissue to get the extra residue off. You can transfer any excess gloss while keeping the overall look to still look clean. Despite how full it makes the lips look, it doesn’t bleed or melt off the lips.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin E <strong>| Shades: </strong>32<strong> | Scented: </strong>No</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-31 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person applies Pat McGrath LUST Gloss to their hand" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/x07pCo_EGimoOKGY1qAeaygwW-Y=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-detail-pat-mcgrath-lust-gloss-jjuliao-0408-8e342b3c0d4942649062ab8d385327cf.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="A person eats after applying Pat McGrath LUST Gloss" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zqluTZvtsLaMN98ISlPF8uPCn7o=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-lip-gloss-oils-test-pat-mcgrath-lust-jjuliao-29249-e736a8dce4b5423c8b2e1ab849faee28.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jessica Juliao</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-maybelline-new-york-lip-lifter-gloss-with-hyaluronic-acid></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maybelline New York Lip Lifter Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maybelline Lifter Gloss with Hyaluronic Acid" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9DSAIqwOoESpXMi0-7nGrr7jGFE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maybelline-lifter-gloss-with-hyaluronic-acid-5135db89cc074348825f44181dc0377d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Maybelline</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Let’s not sleep on these drugstore brands, because a lot of them have been around for decades and know exactly what they are doing.

We promise the sticky sensation fades and becomes comfortable in no time. Even as a self-proclaimed “plumper,” we noticed zero tingling as one normally would with such lip products.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We felt as though it had just the right consistency to allow us to build as needed. Even with two or three layers, it felt neither thick nor runny, remaining light and airy on the lips. What we didn’t understand, however, was how the color looked so opaque in the bottle only to be near-invisible on the lips. It’s more sheer than many of the other lip glosses we tried. That being said, it makes it that much easier to use over lipsticks or lip liners without having any colors clash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Coconut oil, hyaluronic acid <strong>| Shades: </strong>20<strong> | Scented: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shimmer-lancme-juicy-tubes-original-lip-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Shimmer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lancôme Juicy Tubes Lip Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lanc&amp;Atilde;&amp;acute;me Juicy Tubes Original Lip Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EMn07m2gFNqo-YfYTQISTuR_tlM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lancme-juicy-tubes-original-lip-gloss-8b41213e160e4eca8db0d54869b55c15.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>LancÃ´me</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Lancôme Juicy Tubes Lip Gloss had us feeling like we were in an old-school movie, smacking lips and looking bubbly — even the tube is reminiscent of our beloved y2k years. The formula of this gloss is very viscose, and has a nice sparkle to it. When we pushed a bulb of product out, it held its shape until we manually spread it across the lips. There is a slightly tacky feeling when we put our lips together, but not a disturbing amount. We could still drink out of straws without feeling like we kissed away the product or needed to reapply the gloss.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because of how viscose the gloss is, it’s not runny or bleeding over our lip lines. With time, the formula started to merge into our skin, making it look less like it was simply sitting on top of the lips and more like a natural complement to our lips. The color isn’t particularly opaque, so consider choosing a shade that merely brings out your natural lip color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin E <strong>| Shades: </strong>20 <strong>| Scented: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-natural-look-summer-fridays-lip-butter-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Natural Look</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1Wn6PaGYCCTuNIjDaun3H4fH51I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/summer-fridays-lip-butter-balm-a1d5cc98309b40f48510971591d50adf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You know when you look your healthiest — eight hours of sleep, sun-kissed, well-hydrated and all? Summer Friday’s products work to bring out just that. The Lip Butter Balm has six different shades that help make your natural lip color pop. Adding just a tiny bit of tint (yes, the formula looks more opulent in the tube than on the skin), it glosses over the lips in a subtle yet flirty shade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The balm squeezed out of the tube effortlessly and spread over our lips in a single swipe. There’s some stickiness to it, but it didn’t transfer onto our hair in an icky way. It’s neither greasy nor heavy, which was ideal for everyday use. This is definitely something we like to wear to the office, as it’s natural and easy to use. When we weren’t eating or drinking, the balm practically stayed on for hours. That being said, a little nibble or sip of food would require us to reapply — not that we minded, thanks to the refreshing citrusy smell. It was like giving ourselves a midday treat every time we applied.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Shea and murumuru butters, vegan wax, vanilla<strong> | Shades: </strong>6<strong> | Scented: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sheer-jane-iredale-hydropure-hyaluronic-acid-lip-gloss></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sheer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jane Iredale HydroPure Hyaluronic Acid Lip Gloss</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jane Iredale HydroPure Hyaluronic Acid Lip Gloss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uYbaQis-roN9O7IzgHyeOHOGyNM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jane-Iredale-HydroPure-Hyaluronic-Acid-Lip-Gloss-c89c4f0c30f14ef68e8940e865ebbe6e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jane Iredale</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not all people love the juicy and rich look (or feel) of traditional glosses. If you’re one of those people, then opt for this sheer hyaluronic acid lip gloss instead. We found it to be very lightweight and easy to manage, creating a barely-there feel. It simply gave our lips a little smooth shine without any of the tacky feeling. It’s humble nature also allowed it to blend into our lips seamlessly without bleeding or looking patchy. A look in the mirror revealed a pretty pout that didn’t scream for attention. Thanks to the hyaluronic acid, it also felt very moisturizing and comfortable. We didn’t need to layer any lip balm underneath or deal with any tingling, drying sensations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, because it is so lightweight and sheer, it requires a decent amount of reapplications throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Hylauronic acid, botanical blends, lactic acid<strong> | Shades: </strong>13 <strong>| Scented: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-clear-rose-inc-lip-treatment-hydrating-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Clear</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rose Inc.

We were extremely pleased with the pillowy effect it brought onto our lips, making them feel soft and supple with all the moisture that got pumped into them. Immediately after application, we noticed a liquidy shine over our lips that we were very pleased with. The wow factor kept coming as we realized how non-sticky it was, keeping hair off our lips even through wind.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The cons? It didn’t last too long. While the hydration capabilities stayed present even after the gloss wore off, the shine left our mouths after any kind of eating or drinking. We don’t mind reapplying the soft vanilla scent over and over again, but we do fear it will empty out the tube pretty quickly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Rosehip fruit extract, probiotic complex, ginseng extract<strong> | Shades: </strong>1<strong> | Scented: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In order to find the best lip glosses, we first searched the internet for the most popular and well-rated products. We called 20 of the winning options into our testing lab where 20 different women put them through the test. We first took note of how the lip gloss applied — whether it tingled, looked goopy, or felt runny. We then let a fan blow hair into our faces as we tested how sticky the formula was. By pressing our lips against cups and eating granola bars, we were able to see if any product transferred or disappeared. Lastly, any products that came with the added benefit of hydration received extra points. Products that made it past all of our tests won a spot on this article.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each lip gloss is formulated in a unique way to deliver the shine you seek. If you’re looking for more hydrating capabilities, “look for glosses that contain nourishing ingredients like jojoba oil and vitamin E,” says makeup artist Elizabeth Seropian, whose work you’ve seen on celebs like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Cindy Crawford</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Noah Cyrus</a>.

Some glosses, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tower 28 ShineOn Lip Jelly Non-Sticky Gloss</a>, use “oils that can provide a glossy finish without feeling overly sticky on the lips,” she adds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re worried about sensitivity on the lips, board-certified dermatologist Dr. Blair Murphy Rose wants you to look for “fragrance-free and dye-free products that don’t contain skin irritants like menthol, cinnamon, capsaicin, and phenol.” We’ve listed out whether each lip gloss is scented or not, so make sure to double-check before committing to your purchase.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Color</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While a lot of lip glosses are clear, many come in various fun colors that help make your lips pop. Some are more opulent than others, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">NYX Butter Gloss</a>, and almost act as a shiny substitute to lipstick.

Some are more potent in their watery appearance, while others blend with your lips a little more naturally. Those that operate more like a balm, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Rose Inc.

Guerra says to “consider the undertones of your skin. If your skin has warm undertones, look for shades with similarly warm hues like bronzes, golds, deep reds, or rich browns. These colors can complement and enhance the warmth of your skin.” Those working with cool undertones can benefit from “berry shades like deep plums.” If you want to keep things safe, he says that&nbsp; “universally flattering shades on light to medium to deeper skin tones are neutral shades of sand, honey, and molasses. They look natural, yet glowing and beautiful.” Some brands, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Fenty</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lancome</a> allow you to virtually try on the different shades using their online cameras.

The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">MAC Squirt Plumping Gloss Sticks</a> for example contains coconut oil heal the lips while the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Acid Lip Gloss Balm</a> uses hyaluronic acid to lock moisture into skin cells.
