This resulted in a massive increase in his social media fan base, nearly doubling the number of his followers across all platforms.</p><p>MattyB began releasing songs with original lyrics as his popularity grew. He released a cover of I Believe in You as his first song of this type on June 22, 2010. Within a few months, he and well-known performer Tyler Ward worked on a cover of “Just the Way You Are,” which was released on August 11 of that year.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-312717 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MattyBRaps-in-his-music-video-My-First-Girlfriend-source-YouTube..jpg alt=MattyBRaps width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-312717 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: MattyBRaps in his music video My First Girlfriend source: YouTube.</p><p>Soon after, A-list celebrities began to notice him, and in late 2010, he was invited to appear as a guest artist on television shows such as Entertainment Tonight and The Wendy Williams Show.</p><p>Forever and Always, his debut original song was made public on September 8, 2011.

While he does not glorify crime or drugs in his lyrics, he appears to be no stranger to courting controversy, as many popular rappers are.</p><p>His supporters are aware of his irresponsibility because he frequently engages in Twitter fights with people who are much older than him.
