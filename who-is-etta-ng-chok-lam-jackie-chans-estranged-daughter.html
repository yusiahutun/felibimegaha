As a result, many people are curious about the life story of Etta Ng Chok Lam, Jackie Chan’s daughter. She has a troubled relationship with both of her parents for various reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s her story.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Etta_Ng_Chok_Lam></span>Who Is Etta Ng Chok Lam?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Etta Ng Chok Lam is the child of an affair between Jackie Chan and the actress who won Miss Asia in 1990, Elaine Ng Yi Lei. Jackie Chan married Taiwanese actress Joan Lin in 1982, and they remain married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sei_41610972-ca84-2.jpg><p>However, in 1999 it was revealed he’d had an affair with Elaine, who is 19 years younger than him. Chan reportedly cut off contact with Elaine when he discovered she was pregnant. He later admitted his regret in his memoir “Never Grow Up,” where he said he’d “screwed up royally.”</p><p>“When the news broke about an affair I’d had that resulted in a love child, the media frenzy was like a bomb going off,” he said. “It wasn’t a mistake I could fix by saying, ‘I’m sorry.'”</p><p>Etta was born on November 19, 1999, in <a href=#>Hong Kong</a>, where she was raised. She gained the nickname “Little Dragon Girl” in the media due to her father’s fame for his epic action movie roles.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Issues_Does_Etta_Ng_Chok_Lam_Have_With_Jackie_Chan></span>What Issues Does Etta Ng Chok Lam Have With Jackie Chan?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The younger Jackie Chan child does not have a relationship with her famous dad. She disclosed that she does not see him as her father, as he did not help to raise her, and she was entirely raised by her mother, Elaine.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she said she does not hold any grudges against him, even if he was not a good father to her. Still, she does not want to meet him or mend their relationship. Although she gets along better with her mom than her dad, the two have fallen out recently.</p><p>On a few occasions, the young girl accused her mother of being abusive and violent. Elaine once revealed that Etta has a lot of emotional problems, such as anxiety, and needs constant psychological therapy.</p><p>Etta came out as a lesbian in an Instagram post in October 2017, gaining overwhelmingly positive feedback from her followers. “I’m shocked by the support. It’s a little crazy right now, but I hope it leads to good things,” she said at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/66bc9650-f1b5-11e8-9fd7-fe32e1727d94.jpg><p><a href=#>Etta&nbsp;is married</a> to Canadian social media influencer Andi Autumn, and they wed in Toronto. She and her 31-year-old wife claimed they had been left homeless “due to homophobic parents.” Etta posted a photo on her Instagram account showing she and her wife wearing white wedding dresses and holding their marriage certificate.</p><p>Etta wrote: “United by love and law on our wedding day. We have all been hurt, but you will find it if you can dream of love. We have been pursuing happiness since the day we were born. Abused as children who never felt love, we have so much to give.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_China_React_to_News_of_Etta_Coming_Out_as_Lesbian></span>How Did China React to News of Etta Coming Out as Lesbian?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite receiving strong support overseas, Etta faced significant backlash in China and Hong Kong due to societal challenges faced by LGBTQIA+ individuals in those regions. Moreover, Etta and her partner, Andi, have an age difference of over ten years.</p><p>It is alleged that Elaine, Etta’s mother, does not accept Andi as her daughter-in-law, suspecting ulterior financial motives for their relationship. As a result, Etta, the daughter of the renowned actor, relocated to Canada to live with Andi, publicly stating on social media that her parents were homophobic and unwilling to provide support.</p><p>Same-sex marriages are not recognized as legal unions in Hong Kong. Yet, the government acknowledges gay weddings conducted overseas for dependent visas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RideOn_WellGoUSA_Still05-1-1024x576.jpg><p>Furthermore, following the release of Jackie Chan’s latest movie, “Ride On,” he has faced criticism from online fans for neglecting his openly gay daughter, Etta Ng Chok Lam. This controversy arose after a viral video showed a movie clip in which he portrayed a loving father, intensifying the backlash against him.</p><p>The situation involving the film star began after a clip of an emotional scene from “Ride On” circulated. Initially, there was a positive reaction to the sentimental clip. However, public opinion shifted as details of the “Rush Hour” actor’s relationship with his actual daughter reemerged.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jackie Chan disowned his actual daughter for being gay,” one user said. Another said, “He and his daughter are estranged while she is financially struggling.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Etta_Ng_Chok_Lams_Mom_Elaine_Ng_Yi-Lei></span>Who Is Etta Ng Chok Lam’s Mom, Elaine Ng Yi-Lei?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elaine Ng, also known as Elaine Wu, is an actress and former beauty queen. She was crowned Miss Asia in 1990. It seems that mother and daughter are now also estranged.</p><p>Elaine has also faced controversy. She has been accused of being a “bad parent” due to her drinking habits, which she publicly apologized for, according to a 2015 report. ​​”I admitted I was wrong in one aspect as a mother – not giving her [Etta] a sense of security. But she knows I love her,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_Between_Jackie_Chan_and_His_Daughter></span>What Happened Between Jackie Chan and His Daughter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reports say Etta didn’t know her father growing up and never took her biological dad’s last name. Over the years, Etta has openly criticized her celebrity parents through her social media accounts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6aa43a5ee773e81c58721d95575b981b-jackie-chan-martial-arts.jpg><p>Speaking in 2015, she said: “He never existed in my life. I will never regard him as a father.” She added, “I am not angry with my father and have never wished to see him.”</p><p>While estimates have put <a href=#>Jackie Chan’s </a>fortune at around $400 million, he reportedly doesn’t financially support his ex-lover and daughter. A few months before Etta and Autumn tied the knot, they posted a video on YouTube claiming they were “homeless” and sleeping under a bridge “due to homophobic parents.”</p><p>“I don’t even understand what is happening because we’ve gone to the police. We’ve gone to the hospital, the food banks, LGBTQIA+ community shelters, and all of them just don’t give a s**t.” She said in the now-deleted footage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZp2kqa5uusZmmqGnm2K5ormMo5ico5maeqS0wKeqZp2jqb%2Biusaem2ackaq0qcDEq2Y%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-etta-ng-chok-lam-jackie-chans-estranged-daughter.html&text=Who%20Is%20Etta%20Ng%20Chok%20Lam%2c%20Jackie%20Chan%27s%20Estranged%20Daughter%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-etta-ng-chok-lam-jackie-chans-estranged-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-etta-ng-chok-lam-jackie-chans-estranged-daughter.html&title=Who%20Is%20Etta%20Ng%20Chok%20Lam%2c%20Jackie%20Chan%27s%20Estranged%20Daughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-etta-ng-chok-lam-jackie-chans-estranged-daughter.html&title=Who%20Is%20Etta%20Ng%20Chok%20Lam%2c%20Jackie%20Chan%27s%20Estranged%20Daughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-etta-ng-chok-lam-jackie-chans-estranged-daughter.html&title=Who%20Is%20Etta%20Ng%20Chok%20Lam%2c%20Jackie%20Chan%27s%20Estranged%20Daughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-etta-ng-chok-lam-jackie-chans-estranged-daughter.html&description=Who%20Is%20Etta%20Ng%20Chok%20Lam%2c%20Jackie%20Chan%27s%20Estranged%20Daughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-style-baggy-jeans.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 Baggy Jeans Outfit Ideas That Are Totally Wearable">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./using-anglesharp-in-powershell-7-to-parse-webpages.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Using AngleSharp in PowerShell 7 to Parse Webpages">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
