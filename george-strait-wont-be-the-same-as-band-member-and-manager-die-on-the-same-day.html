Our Ace In the Hole treasured band member Gene Elders passed away yesterday afternoon shortly after we lost Erv. All of our prayers go out to both families.</p><p>“Me and the band won’t ever be the same without our brother Gene. We loved him so much. Go play with Mike again Geno. We’ll come join you guys later.”</p><p>Elders played the mandolin and fiddle in Strait’s band since 1984. He also played fiddle in Lyle Lovett’s band for around 11 years.</p><p>George Strait also paid tribute to his friend and longtime manager, who is credited of discovering the singer and making him the star he is today.</p><p>Woolsey had a part to play in several music stars’ careers, from Dierks Bentley and Lee Ann Womack to Clay Walker.</p><p>He worked as a label executive at ABC and MCA Records.</p><p>Woolsey passed away Thursday morning following complications with his <a href=#>health</a> after surgery.</p><p>George Straight called his manager his friend in his tribute, writing: “My manager for around 45 years and most importantly my friend for even longer, Erv Woolsey, passed away this morning. He had complications from a surgery and just couldn’t overcome it.</p><p>“He was a very tough man, and fought hard, but sadly it was just too much. We will miss him so very much and will never forget all the time we had together. Won’t ever be the same without him.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-we-may-never-have-heard-of-george-strait-without-his-manager>‘We may never have heard of George Strait without his manager’</h2><p>Kyle Young, CEO of the County Music Hall of Fame and Museum also paid tribute to George Strait’s manager.</p><p>He said: “Without the savvy and determination of Erv Woolsey, we may never have heard of George Strait.</p><p>“Erv heard Strait in a Texas bar in 1975 and was an immediate fan and proponent, when others said the singer sounded too traditional. Later, as an MCA Records exec, Erv pushed the label to sign Strait in 1981. And when execs urged Strait to change his image and his sound, Erv as his manager backed Strait’s determination to stay true to himself. You know the rest.</p><p>“Strait became a superstar who filled stadiums, and together Strait and Erv helped lead country music back to its traditions.</p><p>“All of us owe Erv Woolsey an enormous debt of gratitude for leading with his convictions and always supporting artists and new talent.”</p><p>Woolsey, born February 15, 1944 graduated from Southwest Texas State University in 1969 after studying business. His career in the music industry began with Decca Records and he worked at various labels before reaching head of promotion at ABC Records’ country division in 1973.</p><p>The music manager started booking George Strait at Texas country club, Prairie Rose. But by 1981, he was working at MCA and convinced the label to sign the singer, and it was the right move, as his first single, Unwound, featured in the Top 10.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-still-worked-together-even-without-a-contract>They still worked together, even without a contract</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1236245135-1024x757.jpg><p>In 1984, Woolsey left the labels to become George Strait’s manager full-time. The pair continued working together even though they no longer had a contract.</p><p>The music star told Billboard in 2013: “Shortly after I was signed in 1981, he quit the MCA job and became my manager.</p><p>“We’ve been friends and business partners ever since. We’ve had one contract that expired back in the ’80s sometime. We’re still together, even though we’ve never signed another contract.”</p><p>Woolsey had a songwriting credit on some of his records too, including I Can Still Make Cheyenne, which released in 1996 and reached number one.</p><p>He served on the board of directors for the Country Music Association and Tennessee Museum of History.</p><p>Woolsey is survived by his son Clint, ex-wife Connie, sister Beth, brother David.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2d%2FcLPEqKmgnV2owbOtyK1ksKeeqXqjsYytn55lo5a6pnnArGSbmZ6Zeq6xzJucq2WRo7FuucCnmKCdomKxqrGMqKVmrJiaerStzJ5knZmpZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeorge-strait-wont-be-the-same-as-band-member-and-manager-die-on-the-same-day.html&text=George%20Strait%20won%27t%20%27be%20the%20same%27%20as%20band%20member%20and%20manager%20die%20on%20the%20same%20day&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeorge-strait-wont-be-the-same-as-band-member-and-manager-die-on-the-same-day.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-strait-wont-be-the-same-as-band-member-and-manager-die-on-the-same-day.html&title=George%20Strait%20won%27t%20%27be%20the%20same%27%20as%20band%20member%20and%20manager%20die%20on%20the%20same%20day" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeorge-strait-wont-be-the-same-as-band-member-and-manager-die-on-the-same-day.html&title=George%20Strait%20won%27t%20%27be%20the%20same%27%20as%20band%20member%20and%20manager%20die%20on%20the%20same%20day" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeorge-strait-wont-be-the-same-as-band-member-and-manager-die-on-the-same-day.html&title=George%20Strait%20won%27t%20%27be%20the%20same%27%20as%20band%20member%20and%20manager%20die%20on%20the%20same%20day" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeorge-strait-wont-be-the-same-as-band-member-and-manager-die-on-the-same-day.html&description=George%20Strait%20won%27t%20%27be%20the%20same%27%20as%20band%20member%20and%20manager%20die%20on%20the%20same%20day" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./global-reputation-of-financial-institution.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Global Reputation of Financial Institution: 8 Tactics for Enhance">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./spotlight-on-ashley-longshore.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Spotlight on Ashley Longshore">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
