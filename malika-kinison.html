At the Comedy Workshop, he joined a comedy troupe known as the Texas Outlaw Comics.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2022/12/22/when-malika-kinison-s-ex-spouse-sam-kinison-first-began-his-career-he-was-based-in-houston-texas-where-he-played-in-several-smaller-clubs--1671705001.png width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>When Malika Kinison's ex-spouse Sam Kinison first began his career, he was based in Houston, Texas, where he played in several smaller clubs. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Instagram</span></strong><p>Kinison relocated to Los Angeles in 1980, intending to find work at The Comedy Store, but he was initially hired on as a doorman instead. As time passed, he struggled to acquire a footing in the business until his brother Bill relocated to Los Angeles to help manage his career. He initially became addicted to alcohol and cocaine but swiftly progressed to freebasing cocaine.</p><p>In August 1985, Sam got his big break by appearing on <strong>Rodney Dangerfield</strong>'s Ninth Annual Young Comedians Special on HBO. In 1985, Kinison made his first appearance on television on Late Night with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>David Letterman</strong></a>.</p><p></p><p>During Letterman's introduction of Kinison to his audience, he cautioned them, "Hold on to your hats. I'm not kidding. Please give a warm welcome to Sam Kinison." Kinison played on his prior role as a Bible-preaching evangelist, taking satirical and sacrilegious digs at the Bible, Christianity, and renowned Christian preacher scandals of his day. He did this while still playing the character of an evangelist.</p><p>The gutsy comedic work of Sam was a significant contributor to his meteoric rise to fame. The words EX REV may be seen in the background of a few of his stand-up performances when the camera pans over the personalized license plate of his 1986 Corvette. He was a Los Angeles rock music scene member and was sometimes seen performing with a touring band.</p><h2><strong>Malika Kinison Was Sexually Assaulted</strong></h2><p>According to Souimari, Malika Kinison's bodyguard <strong>Unway Carter</strong> raped and sexually assaulted her multiple times.
