Since then, the K-pop girl group has released seven studio albums and 12 EPs. The band has also went on four world tours.

We, TWICE, have been waiting for the new tour as much as ONCE has waited, and we are already excited and looking forward to meeting our fans,” Dahyun said. “I’m very excited to be able to meet moe local fans than on previous tours. I want to perform quickly and face the fans directly.”</p><p>Tzuyu continued, “I can feel that many people from all over the world are liking TWICE, but it’s also a strange feeling. We are so happy to be able to show our songs and performances to more fans.” Jeongyeon added, “This tour is scheduled to be the largest of TWICE’s own in many ways, including the concert hall. We will show the best stage for that the fans will not regret coming to the concert. Please look forward to the new look!”</p><p>So how can ONCEs get TWICE tickets, even if they’ve sold out?

We’re excited because we will be able to show a different concept and performance from our previous work,” Nayeon said. Jeongyeon continued, “The title of the new album, Set Me Free, is a song I prepared since last year. I wanted it to come out to the world as soon as possible, so I am elated and happy for it to finally come out.” Momo added, “I especially like the intro performance of the new song, so I want to quickly show the fans a new performance. I hope the fans like it as much as I like it.”</p><p>The K-pop girl group also revealed the creative process behind Ready to Be.”The process of selecting the title song remains in my memory. I always decide by voting with the members. Among the songs in this album, everyone liked ‘Moonlight Sunrise’ and ‘Set Me Free’ and voted for the title track. It was difficult to pick one because they have different moods and charms, and I really liked both songs,” Momo said. Mina added, “I think ‘Set Me Free’ is a song that goes well with both Korean and English lyrics. We hope that the message and charm of the song will be delivered to more fans through the English version.”</p><p>TWICE also explained how the group has stayed so close over the years. “The secret to strong relationships among the members is…I’m curious too! Actually, rather than a secret, the friends who know and sympathize with me the most are our members, so it’s comfortable and always fun. We’ve been together for a long time since we were trainees, so I think we naturally come to understand each other,” Jeongyeon said. Mina added, “I think we had no choice to become close because we have been together for a long time, relying on each other to do various things, including fun and difficult things. All nine members are really nice and like people, so I think our relationship lasts for a long time.”</p><p>The K-pop girl group also told the press about the Ready to Be Tour, which marks their fifth world tour since their debut. “Last year’s encore concert in Los Angeles, USA, was an outdoor stage. I remember feeling warmed up by the warm sunlight during the day and the cool breeze blowing at night. As I remembered the fan meeting I had in Korea before, I thought, ‘I guess I like outdoor stages!’ I think I’ve come to realize,” Sana said.</p><p>Jihyo continued, “Seeing the size of the tour getting bigger, I feel grateful and at the same time enjoy the performance even more. I think I want to repay fans who cherish TWICE and visit the concert hall with great performances and stages, and deliver good energy.”</p><p>Mina added, “It was a the moment when I realized that people love us a lot overseas as well. The weather was really nice during the performance, so I think the members were even more excited.”</p><p><span class=s1>TWICE tickets to the Ready to Be World Tour are available on <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>StubHub</span></a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Vivid Seats</span></a>.
