But the piano virtuoso’s plans were upset when Covid-19 started to spread widely at the beginning of 2020. She has been stuck in her home country ever since.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 32-year-old was born in Shenzhen, southern China, and moved to Germany at the age of five when her father took a job there. She returned to China two years later but left again after finishing school to continue her piano studies at the prestigious Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, and later at The Juilliard School. She is now based in Berlin.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zee Zee, who also goes by Zhang Zuo, her Chinese name, has spent a little over a year now in China, her longest period there since leaving for the United States as a student. She has never before performed with so many Chinese musicians and orchestras.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She has been there so long she has started stumbling over English words, she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/04/30/894eaab8-a7fd-11eb-b289-8dea5309a3db_972x_173928.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s really sad. Like, my friends called me the other day, and they said, ‘oh my god, Zee Zee, you’ve stayed in China for too long, even your accent changed’,” she laughs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zee Zee ﻿does not come from a musical family, but she started the piano young. She had her first taste of classical music as a child in Berlin where, she recalls, taxi drivers listened to Beethoven and almost every cafe played Wagner.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">As a woman, after you give birth, at least psychologically I feel more fearless. Brave, more brave on stage.Zee Zee</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We were living in Charlottenburg, a 10-minute walk from the Berlin Philharmonic. Back then, I didn’t have [the] internet at first, and I didn’t speak German. I didn’t have any friends. So the piano became my only friend and my entertainment,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before Zee Zee returned to China at the age of seven, she was good enough to take part in a piano competition. “Unfortunately, I won a prize. So my parents thought, ‘Oh my god, my kid has talent!’” she says.</p>Her proud parents bragged about her achievement in China and their friends introduced them to the Shenzhen Arts School, where Zee Zee enrolled soon afterwards and where other successful young pianists, such as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Li Yundi</span></a> and Zhang Haochen, were her classmates under the tutelage of Professor Dan Zhaoyi.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘My life in Hong Kong informs how I play’: classical pianist returns for concerts</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zee Zee thrived in the school’s highly competitive environment. She went on to win major international piano competitions, including the coveted Petschek Piano Award at the Juilliard and the 2013 Queen Elizabeth Competition in Belgium.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And now, for the first time since giving birth, she is on the road again. Next month, she will be in Hong Kong to perform Liszt‘s Piano Concerto No 1 with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Christoph Koncz at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre on May 5, and give a solo recital on May 17 – a programme that features works by Liszt, Wagner, Schönberg and Ravel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the year she has been stuck in China because of the coronavirus, Zee Zee has held outreach concerts to expose young children to classical music, drawing inspiration from Chinese-American cellist Yo-Yo Ma’s appearances on children’s TV show Sesame Street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/04/30/880b16c8-a7fd-11eb-b289-8dea5309a3db_1320x770_173928.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her outreach was encouraged by her becoming a mother. She hopes to inspire ﻿children to listen to classical music, although she worries that her daughter will be sick of it because of her constant exposure to it before and since her birth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Looking back, Zee Zee feels she sacrificed other parts of life to become a professional classical musician.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I had such a professional training and was very focused on piano from a very early [age],” she said. “But what I missed was an opportunity to discover more in the humanities or study math or learn another language or go to more movie theatres, have fun with kids.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Growing older and becoming a more mature musician has added nuances and layers to her music. Becoming a mother, she says, also changed her performance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“﻿As a woman, after you give birth,” she says, “at least psychologically I feel more fearless.
