Stretch marks, though natural, can be unsightly. It is quite normal to be conscious of them when flaunting an off-shoulder dress or beachwear. But you need not worry about them anymore as there are tips on how to hide stretch marks and get smoother skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Stretch marks are long, thin streaks or lines that form on the skin and are also known as striae. They typically manifest as parallel bands of skin with a slightly different color and maybe smooth or rough texture. Stretch marks develop when the dermis, the middle layer of skin, tears due to rapid stretching. Our contributor, Dr. Rekha Singh, Dermatologist at Oliva Clinic states the major causes of stretch marks. She says, “Stretch marks are caused by the sudden and rapid stretching of the skin, often as a result of growth spurts, pregnancy, rapid weight gain or loss, and muscle growth from exercise. Genetics also play a role in susceptibility to stretch marks.” Pregnancy, rapid weight gain or quick weight loss, growth spurts during puberty, and certain medical conditions can all result in stretch marks. They are usually persistent but may become less visible with time (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Best Tips on How to Hide Stretch Marks And Get Flawless Skin","1224801","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK436005/","articlepage","/beauty/skin-care/how-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801","1","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","skin-care")'><u>1</u></a>).</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Although it's natural, some of you may want to remove stretch marks quickly and efficiently.

Remember that you should accept your body the way it is, and feel confident about yourself always. But if stretch marks are bothering you, and you wish to get smoother skin, below are some ways to hide as well as remove stretch marks effectively.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=6596b01cd20af><strong>How to Hide Stretch Marks </strong><strong>with Makeup</strong></h2><p>Makeup can be a powerful tool for covering up stretch marks and boosting your confidence. By following these detailed instructions, you can achieve seamless and natural-looking coverage.</p><h3 id=6596b01cd20b4><strong>1. Prep Your Skin</strong></h3><p>Preparing your skin before applying makeup is a pivotal step. Apply a lightweight moisturizer to keep your skin hydra</p><h3 id=6596b01cd20b7><strong>2. Color Correction</strong></h3><p>Color correction can help neutralize the color of reddish or purplish stretch marks. Pick a color corrector that matches the tone of your skin. Use a green corrector for red tones and a yellow corrector for purplish tones. Use your fingertips or a makeup sponge to dab a small amount of the corrector directly on the stretch marks and then gently blend it in.</p><h3 id=6596b01cd20ba><strong>3. Foundation</strong></h3><p><img alt="How to Hide Stretch Marks" title="How to Hide Stretch Marks" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-06/1686213890_shutterstock_2003131340.jpg></p><p>Pick a full-coverage foundation that blends well with your skin tone. Apply a thin layer of foundation over the stretch marks using a flat foundation brush or sponge. Apply a small amount of the product onto the affected area, then gently blend it in a circular motion. Spread the coverage gradually until the stretch marks are sufficiently concealed.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3><strong>4. Concealer</strong></h3><p>Apply a concealer that matches your skin tone. Dispense it in drops and spread it out evenly. Use a small, precise brush to dab the concealer directly onto the stretch marks. Use a clean fingertip or a small brush to gently blend the concealer's edges so that it blends with the surrounding skin.</p><h3><strong>5. Setting Powder</strong></h3><p>Set the makeup with a translucent setting powder to ensure long-lasting coverage and avoid smudging. Dust the powder over the hidden area with a fluffy brush. This process helps the skin become matte and keeps the makeup in place all day.</p><h3><strong>6. Finishing Touches</strong></h3><p>Apply a light layer of setting spray to lock the makeup in place and extend the coverage. Allow the setting spray to dry completely before moving or touching the hidden area.</p><p>Touch-ups may be required throughout the day to maintain coverage. Carry a small makeup sponge or brush with you in addition to your concealer and setting powder for quick and discrete touch-ups as needed.</p><h3><strong>Tips to Get Long-lasting Coverage</strong></h3><p>When using makeup to cover stretch marks, it’s important to follow a few tips to get long-lasting results. Below are some tips that can help you get long-lasting coverage:</p><p>1. Use makeup products that are waterproof and last for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>2. We often get tempted to rub our fingers on makeup areas — but don’t. Avoid touching the concealed areas to avoid smudging.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Use a makeup setting spray to set the makeup properly.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How to Take Care of Your Skin After Makeup Application?</strong></h3><p>Once you have used makeup products to camouflage stretch marks, you must take proper care of your skin. At the end of the day, makeup should be removed using a gentle makeup remover or oil. Anecdotal evidence suggests that dryness too, can cause stretch marks. Hence, use a lightweight moisturizer to prevent dry skin and keep your skin’s barrier healthy.</p><h3><strong>Skin Care Products to </strong><strong>Remove Stretch Marks&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><img alt="How to Hide Stretch Marks" title="How to Hide Stretch Marks" width=1000 height=663 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-06/1686214086_shutterstock_2179590315.jpg></p><p>The best way to hide stretch marks can be using skincare products, including scrubs and retinoid creams. The stretch marks may not completely fade off; however, it is possible to lighten them using dermatologist-approved commercial products. Here are some of the products that can be used:</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3><strong>1</strong>. <strong>Body Scrubs And Exfoliation</strong></h3><p>The texture and appearance of stretch marks can be improved with routine exfoliation.

This can encourage skin regeneration, reduce the visibility of stretch marks, and prepare your skin for makeup.</p><h3><strong>2. Moisturizing</strong></h3><p>After exfoliation, hydrate the skin to make it soft and supple. Keeping your skin hydrated is essential for reducing the appearance of stretch marks. Use a moisturizing cream or lotion containing ingredients such as cocoa butter, shea butter, or almond oil. Massage it into the affected areas twice a day to improve the elasticity and texture of the skin (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Best Tips on How to Hide Stretch Marks And Get Flawless Skin","1224801","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5057295/","articlepage","/beauty/skin-care/how-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801","2","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","skin-care")'><u>2</u></a>).</p><h3><strong>3.

You can make slight changes in your dresses and outfits to blend the stretch marks well. Here are some clothing choices based on anecdotal evidence that may gel well with your stretch marks:</p><h3><strong>1. Patterns And Prints</strong></h3><p>Patterned or printed clothing can draw attention away from stretch marks. Floral prints, geometric patterns, and intricate designs can help conceal and draw attention to different parts of the body.</p><h3><strong>2. High-waisted Bottoms</strong></h3><p>Stretch marks frequently appear on the hips and lower abdomen; these areas can be covered with high-waisted pants, skirts, or shorts. They make the area appear less noticeable and more even and streamlined.</p><h3><strong>3. Layering</strong></h3><p>Adding layers of clothing can help you achieve a stylish look and cover stretch mark-prone areas. To draw attention to other parts of your body and lessen the visibility of stretch marks, layer with cardigans, jackets, or scarves.</p><h3><strong>4. Textured Fabrics</strong></h3><p>Stretch marks can be concealed by fabrics with depth, such as ribbed knits, cable knits, or jacquard patterns. The skin will be less visible because of the texture.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>5. Paperbag Waists Or Draped Styles</strong></h3><p>Stretch marks can be hidden by wearing clothing with draping or ruching at the hips or abdomen. These designs can draw attention away from the presence of stretch marks.</p><h3><strong>6. Shapewear Or Compression Garments</strong></h3><p>Shapewear or compression garments can provide a smooth and streamlined appearance, minimizing the appearance of stretch marks.</p><h2><strong>Tattoos to </strong><strong>Hide Stretch Marks</strong></h2><p>A body tattoo is an intelligent way to hide stretch marks and step up your fashion quotient at the same time. Tattoos are artistic, creative and are permanent. Intricate patterns, floral designs, or other visually appealing motifs can be strategically placed to camouflage the stretch marks. The color palette of the tattoo can help conceal stretch marks. Choosing colors that complement your skin tone or darker shades can help reduce the visibility of stretch marks.</p><p>It is important to consult your dermatologist and your tattoo artist before the tattoo appointment. Ensure that the skin is healthy for tattooing.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2><strong>Tanning to </strong><strong>Hide Stretch Marks</strong></h2><p>Tanning or bronzing the skin is a temporary way to cover up stretch marks. Here are a few things to consider when using tanning to hide stretch marks:</p><ul><li><strong>Natural Or Self-Tanning</strong></li></ul><p>Spending time in the sun will give you a natural tan. You can also get a tan without being exposed to UV light by using self-tanning products. There are many different types of self-tanners, including lotions, sprays, and mousses.</p><ul><li>Application of a Tanner&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Make sure to evenly distribute the tanning product over the entire body, paying special attention to the stretch mark-prone areas. To avoid streaks, use a tanning mitt or glove to blend the product well.&nbsp;</p><p>Tanning is just a temporary way to hide stretch marks. They do not remove stretch marks. If you are opting for sun tans or tanning beds, ensure to use copious amounts of sunscreen lotions and gels to prevent skin changes and sunburns.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Types of Stretch Marks: Red vs. White Stretch Marks</strong></h2><p><img alt="How to Hide Stretch Marks" title="How to Hide Stretch Marks" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-06/1686214165_shutterstock_1673465326.jpg></p><p>Stretch marks appear on the skin in stages. Their color determines the stage of the stretch mark and its manageability (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Best Tips on How to Hide Stretch Marks And Get Flawless Skin","1224801","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5057295/","articlepage","/beauty/skin-care/how-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801","2","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","skin-care")'><u>2</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1. Red Stretch Marks</strong></h3><p>They are typically reddish or purplish in color, raised or slightly inflamed, and appear in the early stages of the development of the stretch mark. As the skin is overstretched, the blood vessels near the surface of the skin become visible, making the striations look red. Due to the stretching of the skin, red stretch marks may be accompanied by slight itching or tenderness.</p><p>The blood vessels keep the skin alive and active, giving us the option of treating them successfully. Red stretch marks are generally more amenable to treatment options such as topical creams, laser therapy, or other interventions.</p><h3><strong>2. White Stretch Marks</strong></h3><p>White or silver stretch marks have a faded or pale appearance, often blending in with the surrounding skin tone. The white color indicates that the initial inflammation, visible blood vessels, and stretching have subsided. They are considered to be in a more mature or inactive state. They have a slightly depressed or indented texture compared to the surrounding skin.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>While it is more challenging to completely eliminate white stretch marks, there are still treatment options available to help improve their appearance, such as laser therapy, micro-needling, microabrasion, or cosmetic surgery.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Ideas on how to hide stretch marks can involve both methods to cover up stretch marks and permanently remove stretch marks. Understand your options before diving into the journey to hide stretch marks. Stretch marks are a part of adulting for both men and women; while some accept them and do not shy away from flaunting them, finding ways to hide them is also normal. Makeup, tanning, and clothes are temporary ways of camouflaging and require repeated touch-ups. Modern dermatology has more permanent fixes to remove stretch marks. Laser therapy, micro-needling, and microabrasion directly involve the dermis of the skin, induce fresh bleeding, and may help in skin regeneration. Work closely with your dermatologist to understand the best way for you to deal with your stretch marks.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Dr. Rekha Singh, MBBS, MD - Dermatology, Venereology & Leprosy - <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Best Tips on How to Hide Stretch Marks And Get Flawless Skin","1224801","https://www.olivaclinic.com/","articlepage","/beauty/skin-care/how-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801","Oliva Clinic","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","skin-care")'>Oliva Clinic</a></p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Best Tips on How to Hide Stretch Marks And Get Flawless Skin",1224801,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/beauty/10-tips-reduce-your-stretch-marks-explained-dermatologist-dr-ajay-rana-523996","articlepage","/beauty/skin-care/how-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801","Content Also read","beauty","skin-care"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Best Tips on How to Hide Stretch Marks And Get Flawless Skin",1224801,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/beauty/10-tips-reduce-your-stretch-marks-explained-dermatologist-dr-ajay-rana-523996","articlepage","/beauty/skin-care/how-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801","10 tips to reduce your stretch marks, explained by dermatologist, Dr Ajay Rana","Also_Read","beauty","skin-care")'><strong>10 tips to reduce your stretch marks, explained by dermatologist, Dr Ajay Rana</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGiZnpmlqcZwv8qipWabkaeycLTOsGStp12dtqWxjKyrq52kmLVuucCroqxlYWd%2FdYSPag%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801.html&text=Best%20Tips%20on%20How%20to%20Hide%20Stretch%20Marks%20And%20Get%20Flawless%20Skin&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801.html&title=Best%20Tips%20on%20How%20to%20Hide%20Stretch%20Marks%20And%20Get%20Flawless%20Skin" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801.html&title=Best%20Tips%20on%20How%20to%20Hide%20Stretch%20Marks%20And%20Get%20Flawless%20Skin" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801.html&title=Best%20Tips%20on%20How%20to%20Hide%20Stretch%20Marks%20And%20Get%20Flawless%20Skin" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-hide-stretch-marks-1224801.html&description=Best%20Tips%20on%20How%20to%20Hide%20Stretch%20Marks%20And%20Get%20Flawless%20Skin" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-fix-this-site-cant-be-reached-err-address-unreachable-in-chrome.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Fix &amp;quot;This Site Can't Be Reached&amp;quot; ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE in Chrome">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./zazie-beetz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Zazie Beetz dating?
