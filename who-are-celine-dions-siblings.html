Let’s meet them.</strong></p><p>If you are an avid music fan, you must have heard of Celine Dion or one of her songs.&nbsp; The “I’m Alive” singer is one of the most famous musicians in the world. She is known for her outstanding vocal ability and exceptional showmanship.&nbsp;</p><p>Celine Dion was born Celine Marie Claudette Dion on March 30, 1968, in Quebec, Canada. She started singing at the age of five with her musically-minded family. At 12, Celine collaborated with her brother Jacques to compose her first song, “Ce n’etait qu’un reve.”</p><p>Around this time, she <a href=#>met</a> music producer René Angélil who helped launch her career with the album “La Voix du bon Dieu” in 1981. The album titled “The Voice of God” in English earned her an award at the World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo in 1982.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/e1/12/44/e11244fb5830cf892551ad26611f470d.jpg><p>In 1983 the album earned Celine her first Felix award. She also became the first Canadian to earn a gold record in France.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Eurovision Song Contest in 1988, Celine, representing Switzerland, won with her performance of the song “Ne partez pas sans moi.” When translated to English, the music means “Do Not Leave Without Me.” It continued to raise her profile as a great musician.</p><p>As she got older, Celine started singing more in English. She did this to make her music more understood and recognized worldwide.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Worldwide_Musical_Success></span><strong>Worldwide Musical Success&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Celine marked the early 1990s with the release of her first English-language album “Unison.” The album contained the romantic ballad “Where Does My Heart Beat Now,” which became her first top-10 single in the United States.</p><p>In 1991 her duet with Peabo Bryson titled “Beauty and the Beast” won them a Grammy Award. Two years later, in 1993, her song “The Power of Love” from the album “With The Colour of My Love” became another hit. Again, she won two Grammy Awards, including album of the year for the project.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1995, she released the album “The French Album,” which became the best-selling Francophone album.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, her most significant moment came in 1997 when she made the song “My Heart Will Go On.” The song, the theme song for the movie “Titanic,” won her an Academy Award and topped charts in multiple countries.&nbsp;</p><p>It propelled the sale of her album “Let’s Talk About Love” into the tens of millions. Nevertheless, as the 2000s began, Celine took a break to focus on her family.</p><p>The musician at the time was <a href=#>married</a> to her manager René Angélil. In 2001 the pair welcomed their first child, son René-Charles, after six years of trying. She returned to the music scene in 2002 with the album “A New Day Has Come” and “One Heart” in 2003.</p><p>Although the musician no longer enjoys the vast success she did in the 90s, Celine has remained a mainstay in the industry.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Celine_Dions_Siblings></span><strong>Celine Dion’s Siblings&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Celine was<a href=#> born</a> into a huge family and is the youngest of 14 children by her parents, father Adhémar-Charles Dion and mother Thérèse Tanguay Dion.
