Toby and Happy share a romantic relationship and fans adore them together.</p><p>During an episode of the series of Season 2 Finale, Toby got&nbsp;down on one knee and proposed 'Happy,'&nbsp;but&nbsp;she confessed to Toby that she was already married! It was not only a big blow to Toby, but the fans were equally shocked and&nbsp;wondered- who is her secret husband? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Caption: Jadyn Wong&nbsp;and Toby Curtis sharing a kiss during an episode of the TV series 'Scorpion.'&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Photo Credit: cbs.com&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Entertainment&nbsp;Weekly Radio tweeted&nbsp;that Happy's secret husband would be unraveled&nbsp;soon!&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>And it turned out that she was married to Walter O' Brien to help him stay in the country. They were&nbsp;good friends, who were just helping out each other!&nbsp;</p><p>However, that was not it!</p><p>On November 2016, a plot twist was introduced in the series, and Happy disclosed to Toby that she was pregnant with Toby's child.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fans were excited about Happy's pregnancy, and the news was all over social media.</p><p>On the series, Happy was confident that she had a baby on the way and was almost done with her high-tech baby crib. But the plot twist didn't end with the revelations of Happy's pregnancy; there was more to unveil.</p><p>Talking about the unexpected pregnancy, during an interview with TV Insider on October 2016,&nbsp;Jadyn Wong <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"There's almost so much fear. I almost see it as one foot in the past and one foot in the future. It's almost like this turmoil in her; that's how I read it. I think there's some fear, also, around children. She didn't really have a childhood. It's like she's scared—she doesn't want to hurt [her kid]; it's the cycle of what you experienced as a child. It's not really knowing if she could do any different."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Additionally, Eddie Kaye Thomas, who was also present during the interview, added,</p><p>"Toby's a really loving guy; he really wants to do the right thing with Happy and this baby It's just going to make this connection even tighter."</p><p>But, the excitement didn't last long, as, after a medical check-up, Happy found out that the cadmium poisoning resulted in the false pregnancy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Talking about Jadyn's romantic union in her life beyond the cameras, she hasn't been spotted with a romantic partner, who could be speculated as her probable boyfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Further, she has not acknowledged a man as her boyfriend so; she remains single in the eyes of the public.
