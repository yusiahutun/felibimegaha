He was a three-time Primetime Emmy candidate. On June 3, 2011, at the age of 88, Arness died of natural causes in his Brentwood home in Los Angeles, California.</h3><h2>At the time of his death, James Arness was worth $8 million</h2><p>James Arness had an estimated net worth of <strong>$8 million</strong> at the time of his death. His money came from his illustrious career as an actor and former military man. He did, in fact, make a lot of money from his role in the TV show Gunsmoke. According to one source, he was paid roughly <strong>$20,000</strong> every episode. According to the same website, The Thing From Another World star made barely $1,200 per episode in the beginning.</p><p>He also appeared in The Farmer’s Daughter, Iron Man, Hondo, The Sea Chase, The First Traveling Saleslady, and more films. In 1960, he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. For his dedication and hard effort, Arness received the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart.</p><h2>Behind the Scenes with James Arness</h2><p>James Arness, whose real name was James King Airness, was born on May 26, 1923, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His father, Rolf Cirkler Aurness, and mother, Ruth Duesler, had him as the eldest son. With his brother Peter Graves, he grew up in his hometown. According to IMDb, Arness stood 6′ 7″ tall and weighed 235 pounds, according to Time magazine (March 30, 1959). He was regarded as Hollywood’s tallest leading man during his time. James graduated from Minneapolis Washburn High School with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. Beloit College awarded him his Alma Master’s degree.</p><h2>Arness’s Career Highlights As A Militant</h2><p>Despite the fact that his parents were businesspeople, he had no interest in the field. Arness had a desire of becoming a naval fighter pilot. However, his poor vision and visual problems were the biggest roadblock on his way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/us-corporal-james-arness-1577008.jpg><p>Arness did, however, serve as a rifleman in the United States’ Infantry Division’s 3rd range. He also arrived on Anzio Beachhead on January 22, 1944, as recounted in James Arness’ Autobiography. During that period, he was assigned to the second platoon as a rifleman. Because of his diminutive stature, Arness was also transported to General Hospital in Clinton, Iowa, by the US Army at the time, where he was the first to be offered a landing craft for determining the water’s complexity. He served in the military as a Corporal from 1943 to 1945.</p><h2>James Arness is a well-known actor</h2><p>He began his career in the entertainment industry as a radio announcer at Minneapolis station WLOL in 1945, after serving in the military. In 1947, James Arness made his cinematic debut with The Farmer’s Daughter. He went on to star in films and television shows such as Gunsmoke, Them!, The Thing From Another World, and The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory, to mention a few. On Gunsmoke, his most remembered character is likely US Marshal Matt Dillon. He played the part for 20 years and cemented his place in the hearts of every American who grew up watching television. He had roughly 48 acting credits before his death, making him one of Hollywood’s more seasoned actors.</p><h2>Wife and children’s personal lives</h2><p>Arness married twice, and both of his wives, Virginia Chapman and Janet Surtees, were actresses. In 1948, he married Virginia Chapman, whom he divorced in 1960.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/james-arness-and-janet-surtees-1.jpg><p>In 1978, he married Janet Surtees with the latter of the two. He had four children with his wife: Rolf Aurness, Craig Aurness, Jim Aurness, and Jenny Lee. Jenny Lee Arness, who was also an actress, tragically committed suicide on May 12, 1975. On the other hand, there was a long-running rumor that James Arness and actress Thordis Brandt were dating, but they never confirmed their relationship in public.</p><h2>What Year Did James Arness Pass Away?</h2><p>At the age of<strong> 88,</strong> James Arness died of natural causes on June 3, 2011. He was survived by his wife Janet Surtees at his home in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, at the time of his death.
